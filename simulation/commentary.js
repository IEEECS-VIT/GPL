    "outside edge, there is no slip, and these are four fortunate runs, came forward to defend, but this was the one that\n went the other way",
    "that is would have pierced the bowler right in half, it's hit hard down to him at long off, couple of bounces, the \nbowler bends and cups his wrists to stop the ball, but it goes through",
    "what a shot, he's walked out, and his momentum has given this lofted push so much distance, it's almost gone over \nthe deep extra cover rope, it is in the gap anyway",
    "scooped fine over the keeper, the batsman comes across, bends and gets enough bat on this length ball",

    "keeps eyes on the ball and twists his wrists very late to send the ball to the rope",
    "this is a very high full toss, and the batsman has sent it screaming over short third man with a neat reverse paddle\n even as he swivels away to avoid getting hit",
    "poor line to given the situation, good length down the pads, and he swipes it to the deep backward square boundary",
    "and finds the boundary this ball, whips a full ball angled in, beats midwicket's jump, and also a sliding attempt \nin the deep",
    "neatly done, very full outside off, not too much width, but the batsman opens the face and times it to deep backward\n point rope",

    "down the pads, swept hard, and well wide of short fine leg",
    "the batsman trying to assert his flow, on the leg side now, this is shortish, be swings it off the front foot and \ntimes it to the deep square leg rope",

    " tossed up on off stump, the batsman plants his front leg down the pitch and slogged it away to the deep midwicket \nboundary. The fielder tried to flick it back into the field of play, but he was stamping on the boundary ropes while doing so",
    "drifting down on the pads and he sweeps him one-bounce to the long leg boundary ",
    " and he's switch hit to the point boundary! Changed his stance and then the grip on his bat and blasted it away to \nthe fielder down there. Pulled out a diving effort but couldn't pull it back",
    "races down the track and though the bowler went short and tried to put it past the reach of the batsman's lashing \nblade",

    "this is short and it allows the batsman to rock back and pull in between the long-on and deep midwicket regions. \nMuscled away.",

    "spots the batsman charging and digs it in short, but makes the mistake of bowling wide. The batsman slaps it over \npoint. Thumping boundary !",
    " pulls out the sweep and it's timed extremely well. He's not bothered with keeping the ball down and why should he,\n when he hits it in the gap",
    "that was a snorter of a bouncer. The eyes came off the ball and he was mostly taking evasive action when the bat \nsort or jutted out and the top edge was taken to run away to the boundary at long leg",
    "that was a set up for the batsman and he's walloped it to the square leg boundary. The bowler bowls waist-high short\n ball and it was the slower one as well. Comfortably dispatched. The ball seems to have caught the cables of the spider-cam and usually it provides grounds for a dead ball, but the umpires give a little leeway"

    "tossed up on off stump, the batsman goes for the slog sweep. This has gained considerable height but there is a man\n in the deep. A fielder camps under it and holds on to a simple chance. Touches gloves with his partner as he walks back",
    "he cannot believe he has top-edged such an innocuous delivery! It was short and sliding well down leg, should have \nbeen pummeled over the fine leg boundary but instead the fielder runs back and takes a simple grab over his shoulder. That should tell us something about the durability of his hands",
    "this is a blinder! The batsman whacks the short of length delivery to deep midwicket, where the fielder lines \nhimself up for the catch.. but he slips.. Despite that, he somehow straightens his body on the ground, keeps an eye on the ball, arches his body back and takes a catch sitting down.. freakish catch.",
    "and he's gone... ironically to a ball that he timed so well.. Probably his best connection of the day.. It was full\n and wide and he crashed it over point, but straight to deep point..the captain is pumped",
    "He is beaten by the extra bounce on this pitch.. the batsman wanted to clip it to the leg side, but this slower \ndelivery got big on him and the leading edge just popped up for the cover fielder..",

    "He tries to whack this inside out, with the spin, to the stands. The idea was right, the execution wasn't as he \nfailed to get distance on this.. The catch is comfortably taken at deep extra cover",

Long-off leaps up to hold down a pretty good catch. Think he was very worried about the rope, but it was well behind him",
    "goes for the slog sweep and he's picked out the man in the deep! He had to drag a good length ball that went on \nwith the arm, which hampers his timing and the man at deep square leg holds on easily",

    "he's picked out deep square leg, who hardly had to move! He looked quite dangerous skipping down the track and he \nconnected pretty cleanly as well. But he forgot all about the placement. A terribly soft dismissal considering the situation",
    "the slower ball has him! It's not a short one though. The batsman backed away to flay the good length offcutter \nthrough the off side and gets a thick outside edge that lobs to short third man. The fielder dives forward and plucks a pretty neat take",
    "the batsman throws his head back! He's spliced a slower, back of a length ball down the throat of mid-off. He was \ntrying his best to make some room to lash it quite a bit squarer than where it ended up but the ball struck him a little too high on the bat and he wasn't able to instill any power into the shot",
    "Three men were hunting down that catch, it was about to land just out of reach but he dives and sticks out both hand\n and plucks it out of it's trajectory!

    "nearly spilled that! Slower ball and short, the batsman rocked back to pull and it was flat over square leg, the man\n in the deep ran to his left and grabbed at it, it popped out and he tried taking it in the second attempt and it slipped out again but he managed in the third attempt",
    "this was a length ball and the batsman made room to clear long-on, he closed the face of the bat as he made contact\n and hence didn't hit it well enough",
    "this was a length ball, the batsman stayed at the crease and looked to clear long-on, didn't get the distance, the \nfielder takes the skier well in front of the rope",
    "he mishits this full delivery, it goes straight and high, stays airborne for an age, but long on judges it neatly",
    "this is a sharp, tumbling take at deep backward square leg, the batsman swung a short of a length ball and the \nfielder has not had to move much",

    "this is outside off now, the batsman gets down on his knee and swings, and inside-edges it into his stumps",
    "finds deep midwicket this time, it was shortish, angled in, right in the pulling zone, he swung it from outside the \ncrease, and into the safe hands of long on",
    "and the plan has worked to perfection, he gets a back of a length ball down the pad, around hip height, tucks it \nfine instinctively, and there is a leg slip waiting to accept the gift",
    "terrific delivery, the bowler leaps as this one kicks from just back of a length around off, straightens on the \nbatsman, he has to play at this, prods, and the thick edge flies low to widish slip",
    "Nothing behind this shot. Caught at long-on",
    "gets a touch too under a length ball, lofts this towards long-off where th fielder takes it overhead",
    "This is a slower-ball length ball hit wide of long-off, but the fielder makes so much ground he doesn't even have \nto dive.",

    "on a length, just outside off, he lazily drives into it. Makes no attempt to keep it down, nor is he trying to hit \nit out of the ground. Provides long-off a sitter.",
    "He is hurried into this shovel-pull. Mostly because the ball is not short enough, and he ends up slicing it to \nsquare leg",
    "he can't believe what he's done, he turns back to the umpire and waits for the crooked finger, this was pitched up \non the off stump, just the right length, the batsman comes forward and there's a thick outside edge to the keeper, it was very obvious, the bowler waits and waits and the umpire does the rest",
    "that was a soft dismissal! This was a length ball outside off and the batsman looked to clear mid-off but it went \noff the bottom half of the bat and as a result it went rather tamely to mid-off",
    "finds the fielder at long-on, makes room and it's mistimed and it is taken at long-on",
    "This was a length ball and he made room to smash this over the off side, top edge and the keeper gets under the skier",
    "this was a friendly full toss, whipped it straight to deep midwicket",
    "finds the man in the deep on the on side, this was a slower ball and bowled a bit short, Warner rocks back and pulls \nin front of square but finds the man at deep midwicket, went straight to him",
    "found the fielder with precision, the batsman was down on his knee to slog, played it flat and found the fielder \nat deep square leg",
    "that's a soft dismissal! But that wasn't a terribly good delivery either, this was short and wide outside off, the \ninvitation was there for the cut but he could only hit it straight to the man at cover, didn't time it well and an easy catch in the end",
    "pushed through on middle and leg as he rocks back and goes for an almighty pull. Hasn't connected it properly and \nthe fielder at deep midwicket takes a tumbling catch to break the opposition's partnership",
    " one slog too many for the batsman and he has to walk back dismissed off a full toss. Sought the wide yorker again \nbut it ends up a lovely delivery to be smacked over the covers but he swung across the line and got a leading edge which is taken by the man in the covers",
    "scooped it straight into the hands of the man at short fine leg. It did not allow the batsman the pace he wanted. \nWalked right across his stumps to manufacture a big shot and perishes",
    "holes out at long-off !. Another full toss outside off but the batsman can't get the meaty part of the bat on this. \nLofts it down the throat of the fielder",
    "safely taken! The batsman was lured into playing an expansive drive on the up and he was an age too early into the \nshot. Gets a leading edge and perishes in quite a tame fashion",
    "taken at long-off! This was full on middle and the batsman made a little room to blast it down the ground. Didn't \nget as much bat as he would have liked as the fielder rushes in and dives forward to pick up a neat, low catch! That was plucked inches off the ground.",
    "caught at the edge of the circle at cover! Fuller delivery on off stump and the batsman tries to force the pace by \nshoveling it over the infield. The ball was too full to get under as well as he would have liked.",
    "goes straight up in the air and the bowler himself takes the catch, albeit after a bit of a juggle. ",
    "what a soft dismissal, caught down the leg side! The captain high-fives his bowler. The batsman shuffled across to \n try and glance it fine but the ball, just short of a good length, runs off the face and the keeper collects another simple catch",
