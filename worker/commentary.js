        "short but not quite wide enough, the batsman flat bats it down to mid-off.",
        "full and outside off, the batsman looks to blast it through the covers but mistimes it. The fielder cuts  the angle and dives to his right to keep it to none",
        "hint of inward dip to start off, the batsman negotiates it well by coming forward and presenting a straight  bat",
        "That was a brilliant piece of bowling ! He must be rewarded with a wicket soon !",
        "Defended off the front foot, the bowler is keen to give the batsman a piece of his mind.",

        "The batsman was into the shot early, the ball drops just short of square leg. Sheepish smiles all around.",
        "That was a whisker away from off stump, dangerous leave there by the batsman",
        "What a terrible delivery, the bowler is lucky to have been let off this time",
        "And we have a comedy of errors here ! The batsman pulls away from a half hearted attempt, the ball hits the  bat nevetheless,   a needless run is called for. A better throw from point would have the non striker out nine times out of ten, but this time the ball just pops up to the man backing up, no run taken.",

He was walking across and the bowler responded with a slower delivery just back of a length. Deceived the batsman as it darted back in at him and his guide to third man was nowhere close to it",
