    "this is good running! No, no.. this is surprising for everyone on the field as the throw from the deep as hit the " +
    "non-striker's end direct. Cover wasn't even keen on taking the throw.. He thought the fielder had been slow but the" +
    " fielder from deep extra cover, makes up for it with an accurate hit. The batsman was well short of the crease there." +
    " No need to check with the third umpire. ",
    "another rising delivery, the batsman gets on top of it and drops it towards backward square leg. He tries to sneak " +
    " a second one as the fielder is placed deep, but the throw comes in and finds the batsman short of the crease.",
    "Very poor running here. The striker dabbed the full delivery to cover point and called for a single, but the non-striker" +
    "  was slow to respond to a late call. He was well short when the throw from point came to the keeper. More of the " +
    "striker's mistake actually, because his partner was responding to his call..",
    "direct hit from extra cover claims him, he drilled this full delivery straight to the fielder and went for the " +
    "single,  replays show he is inches short",
    "fullish and curling in again as the batsman swings across the line. There's a big leg before appeal and the batsman" +
    "  has absently wandered down the pitch. The fielder swoops down on the ball from short cover and races over to the" +
    " keeper's end and flicks the bails off. Terrific presence of mind from the captain",
    "This would have been a catch, but now it might well be a run-out. It was a jaggy delivery and he was looking to " +
    " force it down the ground. But the punch had no power in it. The fielder dives to his right and gets the very tip " +
    "of his fingers on it and luckily, it strikes the stumps",
    "fired this full on the stumps and the batsman drilled it down the pitch, the batsman had set off and had to quickly" +
    "  turn around, the fielder back flicked it to the stumps and he was short, there was barely an appeal and nor did " +
    "the umpire raise the finger, the batsman didn't wait and walk off, for a second we didn't know what was going on!",
    "That looked really tight from a certain distance, so the umpire has called for the big screen's help.   The frame " +
    " shows the batsman marginally out of this line, full credit to the fielder backing up at the right time to exact a" +
    " dismissal.",
    "trouble here, there is a direct hit, superb work from the man at backward point,   the batsman had walked too far " +
    " down the pitch after getting hit on the thigh pad with an incoming ball, the fielder swooped on the ball and found" +
    " him well short",
    "fuller, quicker, wants the leg-bye to point, but there is no run here. The runner has given up, and this time the " +
    " throw doesn't miss",
    "poor from the batsman. The bowler bowls a wayward bouncer, but he is not looking at his partner who has rushed up " +
    "for the bye that gives him the strike. Low alertness and slow running have cost them here. Good presence of mind " +
    "from the keeper, lobbing the throw to the bowler",
    "reaps reward for alertness. This was fired down leg, the batsman can't lay bat onto it. The ball clips his boot on " +
    "its way to Samson, who moves to his left and collects the ball. Having realised that the striker had strayed out of" +
    " the crease in search of a quick single, he lasers a throw and hits the stumps and that too with the gloves on. " +
    "What was the batter doing there?",
    "Another direct hit from the keeper, the non-striker is in trouble, he has to go. He is caught short. OUT flashes " +
    "on the big screen. This was marginally back of a length and on middle, tucking him up for room, the batsman stays " +
    "back and chops it to the keeper. He moves to his left and is quick onto the ball and fires another direct hit, " +
    "this one an under-arm throw",
    "Oh well, he is in trouble, gone by a long way. Dibbly-dobbler on off, the striker waits on it before before choppin" +
    "g it down to short third. He takes off for a single, his partner is late to respond. He is not the best of runners" +
    " between the wickets either. A man in the deep Nails a direct hit to signal the doom. Fine, flat throw",
    "and he walks off. Sharp work from the man at point, he had only one stump to aim at it and he lasers a direct hit. " +
    "Back of a length and outside off as the striker takes a step out and punches it to point. He drifts off for a single," +
    " but is sent back. He pulls off a desperate dive, it ends in vain. Point moved to his right, dived and grabbed the " +
    "ball even as it swerved away. He lost his balance but managed to hit the bullseye. Aiming like a boss...",
    "takes an aim at the stumps, hits and catches him short. His partner is back on strike, though. Yorker, which is " +
    "squirted back to the bowler. The non-striker sets off, and the striker scarifies himself for the cause. Lightning " +
    "throw from extra cover",
    "so much is happening here, and there is run out at the end of it! He pushed the slower ball back to the bowler, " +
    "who got a hand to it and the ball deflected towards cover. The striker is more than halfway down the pitch but the " +
    "over fielder has done a Jhonty Rhodes - he doesn't move - and he gets an underarm direct hit at keeper's end by the" +
    " time the striker dives back",
    "quick short ball on the leg side, it's not a wide, and square leg gets the ball from the keeper to hit the stumps " +
    "this time. We have a run out!",
    "run out chance, gone to the third umpire! Worked the ball towards sweeper cover in the deep, they had no choice " +
    "but to go for two. But he fell couple of inches short with that accurate throw",
    "meaty blow, superb fielding in the deep from and the batsman is run out, would you believe it! He middled it for " +
    "the cow corner boundary, where the fielder fell over the boundary while taking the catch but made sure he threw " +
    "the ball back in just before that. The batsmen settled for one initially and realised a little late there was time" +
    " for a second. The batsman  is not completely fit and is slow to come back for the second. Accurate throw and he's " +
    "well short, what a faux pas",
    "has he been run-out? This was slid through on the stumps, punched down the track. the fielder follows the ball, " +
    "dives and deflects it back onto the non-striker's end all in one motion. During the process, he had also collided " +
    "with the striker, who was thrown off balance and lost his bat and landed on his glove. Looks like the bails came " +
    "off the groove before he landed on his right glove and made his ground. The TV umpire examines it from various " +
    "angles and gives it OUT! Unfortunate state of affairs here. Full marks to the fielder, though, for the presence of " +
    "mind",
    "Sharp work from the man at backward point. He nails the stumps at the striker's. The bowler nips this one back " +
    "into the batsman after going wide of the crease, who does not meet with the flick, the ball wanders away behind " +
    "point. The pair want to sneak in a leg bye. He moves quickly to his left, collects the ball and flings an " +
    "accurate throw at the bull's eye. The victim is well short",
    "wide yorker, with the batsman making room. Great option from the bowler and the batsmen wanting to sneak a bye " +
    "hurts them. The non-striker is late to respond and is beaten by the throw from the keeper back to the bowler, and " +
    "then the bowler racing back to knock the stumps over",
    "run out on the last ball as he drives the last ball straight to cover, the fielder throws the ball to the bowler " +
    "and there's no way the batsman can get there",
    "dropped at long-on! Th batsman waited for the slower ball and lofted it down the ground, where the fielder had " +
    "enough time to take a few steps in but he spills it. At least he throws it quickly and the batsman can't come back" +
    " in time",
    "full and wide, flat-batted to long-off. The batsman ran back, his partner sent him back, and he " +
    "had no chance of turning back and making his ground as the fielder, fired in a low, flat throw to the stumps",
    "fullish outside off, checked drive to mid-off. They go for the single, and the thrower goes for the keeper's end " +
    "and hits the stumps direct. The fielding team is already celebrating, but it's gone to the third umpire. You can " +
    "see why. The batsman is stretching but he's well short of the crease. Sharp thinking, and a brilliant flat throw. " +
    "The victim started running a touch too late, and was watching the fielder as he ran.",
    "short outside off, and that's a convoluted way for a bad ball to get a wicket. It stopped on the pitch a bit, and " +
    "the striker, shaping to cut, ended up flat-batting it back to the bowler, who fielded it and turned around in a " +
    "flash to flick the ball at the stumps, too quick for him, who struggled to return to his crease.",
    "yorker now, on middle and leg. LBW appeal from the bowler, but it isn't given. It's leg byes, ricochets to the " +
    "keeper, who runs to the stumps and runs him out. On replay, that lbw shout looked plumb in front of middle stump.",
    "slower ball outside off, and he's gone for a needless wander, and the fielder has run him out. The batsman went " +
    "for the big slog, missed, and took a few steps down the pitch, looking for the bye. His partner wasn't interested. " +
    "The fielder spotted it quickly and threw at the stumps and hit them direct, and his run has come to an end.",
    "run out chance, it's the keeper's smart work again despite a wide throw, the decision goes upstairs! Replays show " +
    "out despite the dive, out by a couple of inches. The batsman punched at the ball towards sweeper cover, initially " +
    "they might have thought of two and he turned around quickly, so did his partner but said no after a couple of " +
    "steps. The throw at keeper's end was wide, the keeper came out of the crease and parried the ball to the stumps",
    "full toss gets a wicket, it's a run out, so what? he slashed at the high full toss that was well outside off, " +
    "sweeper cover came around as the batsmen looked for the second. It was a pretty flat throw, the man backing up went" +
    " to his right a bit, collected and threw the ball to the stumps, like Dhoni, to send the batsman back",
    "A run-out chance and they go upstairs. He dives across to his right and deflects the ball onto the non-striker's end." +
    " His bat is in the air. He has to depart after drifting out of his crease and backing up. This was darted flatter " +
    "and on middle, the batter drills it ram-rod straight. The bowler manages to tip it onto the stumps. Raina's bat was" +
    " in the air when the bails came off the groove"
