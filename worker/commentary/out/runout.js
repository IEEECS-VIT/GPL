        "this is good running! No, no.. this is surprising for everyone on the field as the throw from the deep as hit the non-striker's end direct. Cover wasn't even keen on taking the throw.. He thought the fielder had been slow but the fielder from deep extra cover, makes up for it with an accurate hit. The batsman was well short of the crease there. No need to check with the third umpire. ",
        "another rising delivery, the batsman gets on top of it and drops it towards backward square leg. He tries to sneak  a second one as the fielder is placed deep, but the throw comes in and finds the batsman short of the crease.",
        "Very poor running here. The striker dabbed the full delivery to cover point and called for a single, but the non-striker  was slow to respond to a late call. He was well short when the throw from point came to the keeper. More of the striker's mistake actually, because his partner was responding to his call..",
        "direct hit from extra cover claims him, he drilled this full delivery straight to the fielder and went for the single,  replays show he is inches short",
        "fullish and curling in again as the batsman swings across the line. There's a big leg before appeal and the batsman  has absently wandered down the pitch. The fielder swoops down on the ball from short cover and races over to the keeper's end and flicks the bails off. Terrific presence of mind from the captain",
        "This would have been a catch, but now it might well be a run-out. It was a jaggy delivery and he was looking to  force it down the ground. But the punch had no power in it. The fielder dives to his right and gets the very tip of his fingers on it and luckily, it strikes the stumps",
        "fired this full on the stumps and the batsman drilled it down the pitch, the batsman had set off and had to quickly  turn around, the fielder back flicked it to the stumps and he was short, there was barely an appeal and nor did the umpire raise the finger, the batsman didn't wait and walk off, for a second we didn't know what was going on!",
        "That looked really tight from a certain distance, so the umpire has called for the big screen's help.   The frame  shows the batsman marginally out of this line, full credit to the fielder backing up at the right time to exact a dismissal.",
        "trouble here, there is a direct hit, superb work from the man at backward point,   the batsman had walked too far  down the pitch after getting hit on the thigh pad with an incoming ball, the fielder swooped on the ball and found him well short",
        "fuller, quicker, wants the leg-bye to point, but there is no run here. The runner has given up, and this time the  throw doesn't miss"
