    "how soft is that? Chipped back at the bowler. Good length ball outside off, stops on the batsman, who aims to flick " +
    "it away, instead he lobs it back to the bowler, who moves to his right and snags the catch",
    "Slower from outside off, he marched down the ground and slapped the ball back to the bowler, who took it around " +
    "waist height with both hands",
    "'Come on', yells the captain, after the fall (Irony, thanks for stopping by) This was a tossed up delivery from " +
    "around the stumps. Tailing in on off, which might have been what tempted the batsman to seek midwicket with the " +
    "closed face. Plays too early and takes the leading edge back to the bowler who takes a good, low catch diving to " +
    "his right",
    "This is a slower ball and what does he do? he chips it straight back at the bowler",
    "the most bizarre things are happening here! It was a slower bouncer outside off, the batsman got into position " +
    "early to pull it to leg, but it stopped on him and he played a slow slap back to the bowler, who took the catch " +
    "with his right hand",
    "The fielder pouches the leading edge at short third man! The slog goes all wrong, the fielder held this one back.",
    "good riposte from the bowler, sharp return catch. His knock has been cut short. This was pushed through flatter, he" +
    " looks to punch it away but ends up chipping it to the left of the bowler, who moves across, takes it and tumbles " +
    "onto the ground",
    "Return catch, the bowler strikes! The batsman is hanging around, though. They go to the TV umpire. This was pushed " +
    "through flatter and quicker just outside off, he seeks to pull it but does not control it, lobbing it back to the " +
    "bowler, who bends low to complete a clean catch. The umpire raises his forefinger",
    "caught and bowled! The shorter ball is too quick for the batsman, who swivels towards the off and tries to pull. He" +
    " gets a top edge that lobs towards short leg, he runs across and catches it easily",
    "superb bowling! This one skids into the batsman, moves in sharply and bounces extra as well. The striker plays a " +
    "nothing pull and ends up top-edging it for the bowler to take the return chance."
