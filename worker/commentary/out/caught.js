    "whoa what a catch! You beauty! The batsman gets a faint edge as he waits on the back foot and the man at slip dives  to his right to swoop it low with one hand.. Superb catch",
    "tries to cut this length ball over point, finds the man with a palpably mistimed shot",
    "very slow short ball, so he has to try and create his own momentum on the pull, but only manages to drag it tamely  to deep midwicket",
    "The fielder pulls out the chainsaw after clinging on to a flat, hard hit from him. It was full and the batsman  moved his front leg to give himself room, he struck it well but has pinned down the man in the deep",
    "slower ball on off stump, he goes for a slog but doesn't connect well enough. Deep midwicket holds on to a straight  forward catch",
    "overpitched just outside off, the batsman gets under it but hasn't gotten the elevation. Hits it hard and flat and  straight into the hands of long-on.",
    "tossed up on off stump, the batsman goes for the slog sweep. This has gained considerable height but there is a man  in the deep. A fielder camps under it and holds on to a simple chance. Touches gloves with his partner as he walks back",
    "he cannot believe he has top-edged such an innocuous delivery! It was short and sliding well down leg, should have  been pummeled over the fine leg boundary but instead the fielder runs back and takes a simple grab over his shoulder. That should tell us something about the durability of his hands",
    "this is a blinder! The batsman whacks the short of length delivery to deep midwicket, where the fielder lines  himself up for the catch.. but he slips.. Despite that, he somehow straightens his body on the ground, keeps an eye on the ball, arches his body back and takes a catch sitting down.. freakish catch.",
    "and he's gone... ironically to a ball that he timed so well.. Probably his best connection of the day.. It was full  and wide and he crashed it over point, but straight to deep point..the captain is pumped",
    "He is beaten by the extra bounce on this pitch.. the batsman wanted to clip it to the leg side, but this slower  delivery got big on him and the leading edge just popped up for the cover fielder..",
    "tries to be cheeky but pays the price... He moves across the stumps to flick the full delivery fine, but only lobs  it to short fine leg fielder",
    "how far has that gone! not too far unfortunately for the batsman. He made room, got a slower ball, lifted it towards  deep midwicket and looked like he made a good connection... But that went straight into the bucket hands of the fielder",
    "He tries to whack this inside out, with the spin, to the stands. The idea was right, the execution wasn't as he  failed to get distance on this.. The catch is comfortably taken at deep extra cover",
    "tries to hammer the ball towards long-on, but he fares even worse. He could only get it as far as mid-off.",
    "that's the end of him as he slaps a length delivery straight to long-off. He didn't really time it as well as he  would have liked.",
    "leading edge to cover point now! Fuller on off, with some shape on it. He looks to play a loose push towards mid-on  but closes the face too early. The fielder takes a simple catch",
    "he top-edges it to the man in the deep on the leg side",
    "shortish again and the batsman goes for a pull. Only succeeds in getting a top edge that soars into the night sky  before settling in the hands of cover",
    "goes straight to long-off ! The bowler pulled his length back a little, the batsman still went after it. But he  picked out the fielder. Punches his bat in disgust",
    "straight to long-off. The batsman chooses a very bad shot there as he looks to smite it down the ground. Gets it  off the bottom of the bat, which turns in his hands, and he controls a simple catch",
    "is forward and looks to clip through midwicket, closes the face too early and gets a leading edge that is pouched  by the bowler himself. Punches the air and screams in triumph",
    "slowed it up this time and the extra flight dupes him. The batsman doesn't hold back as he goes over the top again.  This time it's the leading edge that gains more height than distance. Long-off leaps up to hold down a pretty good catch. Think he was very worried about the rope, but it was well behind him",
    "goes for the slog sweep and he's picked out the man in the deep! He had to drag a good length ball that went on  with the arm, which hampers his timing and the man at deep square leg holds on easily",
    "he was looking to cut it into the gap behind point but the ball gained just a little more bounce and he steered it  straight into the hands of the square fielder",
    "he's picked out deep square leg, who hardly had to move! He looked quite dangerous skipping down the track and he  connected pretty cleanly as well. But he forgot all about the placement. A terribly soft dismissal considering the situation",
    "the slower ball has him! It's not a short one though. The batsman backed away to flay the good length offcutter  through the off side and gets a thick outside edge that lobs to short third man. The fielder dives forward and plucks a pretty neat take",
    "the batsman throws his head back! He's spliced a slower, back of a length ball down the throat of mid-off. He was  trying his best to make some room to lash it quite a bit squarer than where it ended up but the ball struck him a little too high on the bat and he wasn't able to instill any power into the shot",
    "Three men were hunting down that catch, it was about to land just out of reach but he dives and sticks out both hand  and plucks it out of it's trajectory! It was on a length but was hit it a little too high on the bat. It was a very difficult skier somewhere beyond the circle in the midwicket region but he was quick enough and athletic enough to pull it off",
    "full and slow delivery mishit over midwicket, a fielder runs across from long on and takes a tumbling catch",
    "he backs away, the delivery is angled in full and the batsman lifts it tamely to mid off",
    "this has gone miles in the air as the batsman steps out, is not to the pitch of one that straightens, but goes through  with the shot, long off settles under it",
    "tried to fetch this short of a length ball from way outside off and flat-bat it down the ground but he has not got  enough elevation on the mishit, mid off times his jump to take a sharp catch",
    "he keeps it on a good length, around off, the batsman tries to force it square on the leg side, misses and the  bowler hits off with slight away movement",
    "this has kicked up from just back of a length, the surprised batsman jabs at it and it pops tamely to point",
    "strikes early, length ball moving away outside off, the batsman stands and wafts, and feathers it behind",
    "full into leg stump, the batsman clears front leg, gets under it and lifts it straight to long on",
    "swats this full delivery flat and straight to long off! Brilliant judgement !",
    "and he's managed to hold on! The batsman swats a length ball to long off, he comes forward and across and takes it  quite safely",
    "slogs probably as hard as he can, but just fails to clear deep midwicket, where the fielder moves to his right to  take a well-judged catch very close to the rope",
    "he top-edges it to the man in the deep on the leg side",
    "played away from the body and he miscued it to long-off",
    "this was tossed up outside off and the batsman made room to carve that over cover, the fielder ran to his right at  cover and took the catch easily at the edge of the circle",
    "straight to deep midwicket, the batsman attempts to slog that for a six over deep midwicket, fetches it from outside  off, it went flat to the fielder,",
    "gets the line and length spot on this time! The away swinger gets him, swung away from the middle stump, the batsman  was compelled to go for the drive, thick outside edge to the keeper",
    "made a lot of room and charged down the track looking to clear the off side, unfortunately he made too much room  and the ball spooned off the bottom of the bat, the fielder ran backwards at mid-off and hung on on the dive just as the ball was leaving him, the fielder covered a lot of ground getting to the ball, amazing stuff",
    "has pulled off quite a stunner! The batsman looked to clear the straight boundary, it was high in the air and hes  was running back from mid-off, the running catches are the toughest, hung on to it and fell backwards",
    "this time the fielder takes a terrific catch, the batsman has flopped, a length ball and he wanted to play that  inside-out, bat turns as he plays that and the ball loops towards cover, the fielder has some ground to cover, he sprints to his left and pouches that one",
    "gets him with the slower ball, it was short and teh batsman swiveled and looked to pull it to fine leg, just shaved  the face of the bat on the way to the keeper",
    "nearly spilled that! Slower ball and short, the batsman rocked back to pull and it was flat over square leg, the man  in the deep ran to his left and grabbed at it, it popped out and he tried taking it in the second attempt and it slipped out again but he managed in the third attempt",
    "this was a length ball and the batsman made room to clear long-on, he closed the face of the bat as he made contact  and hence didn't hit it well enough",
    "this was a length ball, the batsman stayed at the crease and looked to clear long-on, didn't get the distance, the  fielder takes the skier well in front of the rope",
    "he mishits this full delivery, it goes straight and high, stays airborne for an age, but long on judges it neatly",
    "this is a sharp, tumbling take at deep backward square leg, the batsman swung a short of a length ball and the  fielder has not had to move much",
    "the batsman sees deep point, and he will take him on of course, slices this widish back of a length ball straight  to the man.",
    "advances out to a flat one and lifts it straight into the hands of deep midwicket",
    "he slashes this short of a length ball in the air and straight to third man",
    "The bowler cranks it up on this ball, the batsman turns on one leg, trying to lift it over square leg, but he is not  so lucky this time, loops straight to the man",
    "this is outside off now, the batsman gets down on his knee and swings, and inside-edges it into his stumps",
    "finds deep midwicket this time, it was shortish, angled in, right in the pulling zone, he swung it from outside the  crease, and into the safe hands of long on",
    "and the plan has worked to perfection, he gets a back of a length ball down the pad, around hip height, tucks it  fine instinctively, and there is a leg slip waiting to accept the gift",
    "terrific delivery, the bowler leaps as this one kicks from just back of a length around off, straightens on the  batsman, he has to play at this, prods, and the thick edge flies low to widish slip",
    "Nothing behind this shot. Caught at long-on",
    "gets a touch too under a length ball, lofts this towards long-off where th fielder takes it overhead",
    "This is a slower-ball length ball hit wide of long-off, but the fielder makes so much ground he doesn't even have  to dive.",
    "pitches this up on middle and leg, drilled to long-on where the fielder times his leap to perfection to take this  overhead",
    "on a length, just outside off, he lazily drives into it. Makes no attempt to keep it down, nor is he trying to hit  it out of the ground. Provides long-off a sitter.",
    "He is hurried into this shovel-pull. Mostly because the ball is not short enough, and he ends up slicing it to  square leg",
    "he can't believe what he's done, he turns back to the umpire and waits for the crooked finger, this was pitched up  on the off stump, just the right length, the batsman comes forward and there's a thick outside edge to the keeper, it was very obvious, the bowler waits and waits and the umpire does the rest",
    "that was a soft dismissal! This was a length ball outside off and the batsman looked to clear mid-off but it went  off the bottom half of the bat and as a result it went rather tamely to mid-off",
    "finds the fielder at long-on, makes room and it's mistimed and it is taken at long-on",
    "This was a length ball and he made room to smash this over the off side, top edge and the keeper gets under the skier",
    "this was a friendly full toss, whipped it straight to deep midwicket",
    "finds the man in the deep on the on side, this was a slower ball and bowled a bit short, Warner rocks back and pulls  in front of square but finds the man at deep midwicket, went straight to him",
    "found the fielder with precision, the batsman was down on his knee to slog, played it flat and found the fielder  at deep square leg",
    "that's a soft dismissal! But that wasn't a terribly good delivery either, this was short and wide outside off, the  invitation was there for the cut but he could only hit it straight to the man at cover, didn't time it well and an easy catch in the end",
    "pushed through on middle and leg as he rocks back and goes for an almighty pull. Hasn't connected it properly and  the fielder at deep midwicket takes a tumbling catch to break the opposition's partnership",
    " one slog too many for the batsman and he has to walk back dismissed off a full toss. Sought the wide yorker again  but it ends up a lovely delivery to be smacked over the covers but he swung across the line and got a leading edge which is taken by the man in the covers",
    "scooped it straight into the hands of the man at short fine leg. It did not allow the batsman the pace he wanted.  Walked right across his stumps to manufacture a big shot and perishes",
    "holes out at long-off ! Another full toss outside off but the batsman can't get the meaty part of the bat on this.  Lofts it down the throat of the fielder",
    "safely taken! The batsman was lured into playing an expansive drive on the up and he was an age too early into the  shot. Gets a leading edge and perishes in quite a tame fashion",
    "taken at long-off! This was full on middle and the batsman made a little room to blast it down the ground. Didn't  get as much bat as he would have liked as the fielder rushes in and dives forward to pick up a neat, low catch! That was plucked inches off the ground.",
    "caught at the edge of the circle at cover! Fuller delivery on off stump and the batsman tries to force the pace by  shoveling it over the infield. The ball was too full to get under as well as he would have liked.",
    "goes straight up in the air and the bowler himself takes the catch, albeit after a bit of a juggle. ",
    "what a soft dismissal, caught down the leg side! The captain high-fives his bowler. The batsman shuffled across to   try and glance it fine but the ball, just short of a good length, runs off the face and the keeper collects another simple catch",
    "a shortish ball down the leg side, wasn't the most threatening delivery, the batsman wanted to pull that away,   can only glove it away, easy catch for the keeper",
    "slower ball on off stump, he goes for a slog but doesn't connect well enough. the fielder is at deep midwicket and holds on to a straight forward catch",
    "pulls out the chainsaw after clinging on to a flat, hard hit from the batsman. The bowler is on a roll here. It was full and he moved his front leg to give himself room, he struck it well but has pinned down the man in the deep",
    "tossed up on off stump, the batsman goes for the slog sweep. This has gained considerable height but there is a man in the deep. A fielder camps under it and holds on to a simple chance. Touches gloves with his partner as he walks back",
    "overpitched just outside off, the batsman gets under it but hasn't gotten the elevation. Hits it hard and flat and straight into the hands of the man at long-on.",
    "charges at the bowler who pulls the length back, and the top edge flies over the keeper's head. The slip runs back to take an easy catch",
    "short ball, he has sent it straight down the throat of deep midwicket. The bowler plays a part in yet another wicket. Just one of those shots, though. The ball deserves to be hit, but it has perhaps skidded on to him, and he is hurried into the pull. Easy catch for the man at deep midwicket",
    "it is a goodie from the man in the deep. THe batsman backs away again to go over extra, but is cramped up this time, which means he ends up hitting it mush straighter than he wants to. The fielder camps on the fence, and takes this coolly overhead",
    "It's onto the batsman quicker than he expected. He was in an uncomfortable half-forward position, no position from which to pull - it wasn't short enough for that either - and he top-edged it high in the air, simple catch for the man at deep square leg",
    "down the track now, doesn't reach the pitch, and he picks out that man again. The bowler tossed it up slower and wider, and Tare had to reach out in front of his body to hit that, ended up hitting it straight down long-off's throat",
    "the captain had two slips in place, and the batsman has steered this one straight into first ones hands. Back of a length outside off, left the batsman off the pitch. Simply poked at it with an open face, a nothing shot, and it flew off the outside half of the bat and into the fielder's palms at a comfortable chest height",
    "he never looked comfortable against him, trying to manufacture shots. Yet again he tries a shot that is not on. Looks to go over mid-on, but this length ball is too close to him, and he has sent this straight down mid-on's throat.",
    "He tries one shot too many. The bowler has run his fingers on this. Slightly off-pace with another forceful shot, and he is early into it. The outside edge is pouched by the keeper",
    "this is not the smartest bit of batting. He has fallen to an old little trap from the skipper. More experienced batsmen do better. The captain has guessed that off side is his game, and has placed a deep point and opened the third man region. The next three balls: a slog into the leg side, an attempt to open the face, and another slog. This slog goes a mile in the air and settles with the man at extra cover. You have got to make them work harder for your wickets",
    "soft. Softest ever. Any softer and it would be molten wax. He looks like Duncan Fletcher giving catching practice to the slips and point. Just opens the face on a short and wide ball to give point an easy catch",
    "he is not looking at the ball as he pulls. There has been a plan to bowl at his head, he has managed to keep it down twice, but this time he is late into the pull. The head falls away, he is not looking at it, and the ball comes and hits the bat as opposed to the hat hitting the ball. Easy catch for midwicket",
    "slogs, mis-hits a length ball, he top-edges it to deep midwicket, and the striker has done half his job of getting off strike, but has managed no run off it. Easy catch for deep midwicket",
    "strikes early. The batsman perishes. He races down the track, manufactures a length ball, skews it off the bottom of the bat. That is a dolly for mid-off as the batsman makes a hash of the lofted stroke",
    "and he has nicked off! THe bowler is on a roll #like a boss. This was a teasing fullish ball sliding outside off, the batsman is lured into pushing at it and the outside edge is held by the keeper",
    "and the bowler takes down his man! This was dragged short and wide outside off, so he seeks to pull it away. He has to settle with a thick top-edge. Straight down the gullet of deep third man ( not literally). Eys hopeful, he looks back at the umpire and waits as the umpires check for a possible no-ball. It is a legal delivery and his knock has been cut short",
    "in the action again, this time pulling off a smart-looking catch. Full toss around the leg-stump line, he goes down on one knee, but does not get enough power behind the slog-sweep. Holes out to long-on. He snapped it, realised that he was close to the ad boards, and then regained his balance and pouched it on the rebound. The second grab does it for him in the end.",
    "and he's gone! The bowler delivers the customary early breakthrough. The coaching outfit look pleased in the dug-out. This was full and sliding across, who chases it only to nick it through. The outside edge is well held by Sanju, diving across to his right.",
    "the fielder completes a superb catch. He backed away and aimed to smash this back of a length ball away over the off side, but does not get hold of it. Mid-off moves to his left, dives and snaffles the take",
    "and he finally has a wicket! This one lifts from a length outside off, the batsman looks to go over the leg side. His crude heave translates into a leading edge, which is swallowed by deep third man after running to his right",
    "perishes after being hoodwinked by the bowler's change of pace. Oh wait, the umpires are checking for a possible no-ball. He may have had some part of his heel behind the bowling crease. Aims to go big and holes out to long-off",
    "what an insane catch! Superb tag-team work from the bowling team. What presence of mind. The fielding has veered from ordinary to extraordinary tonight. This is an extraordinary assisted hokey-pokey catch. On a length and on the leg stump, Bailey attacks it and sends it over midwicket. Tim Southee leaps, plucks out his right hand and takes it. But his balance is awry as he looks to go over the ad boards. However, he has the presence of mind to tag it to a nearby fielder, who dives across and pouches it",
    "and the batsman picks out cover now. Good catch st long on, for it was travelling at the rate of knots. Too full and outside off, he flays a drive. The fielder hops up and cover and takes it around chest-height. Ouch, that must sting.",
    "in the air and the catch is taken, at long on! The batsman slapped the short ball from outside off down the ground. The ball was in the air for some time and became an easy catch for long on",
    "it's high, it's not off the middle of the bat, and he's taken at deep midwicket. The batsman slog-sweeps the fullish delivery from middle and leg, it goes high enough for the fielder to take it easy in the deep",
    "not long before he targets that leg-side boundary, but he's caught in the deep! He went back in the crease to whip that short of length ball to the long-leg boundary, gets some distance but long leg takes it right at the boundary. The bowler roars, he has some whiskers too",
    "that goes high and straight down the ground, a fielder runs to his left from long on and takes a good catch on the move. Back of length it was, our culprit slogged to the leg side and got a leading edge",
    "loud appeal for a catch down leg and the finger's gone up, he is gone! Good pace and bounce for the short ball as it was going down leg, he pulled, got some glove before the keeper took a good catch",
    "the bowler strikes! The slower ball works for him. Too full and wide outside off, perhaps, looks to loft-drive it over the infield. But ends up slicing it to backward point. Undone by the slow off-cutter",
    "runs down the track but mis-hits the lofted stroke, holes out to long-off, who follows the ball, watches it all along and pouches it safely",
    "holed out to deep midwicket, where the fielder leaps near the boundary and completes a sharp catch. Short and on the leg stump as the batsman backs away and the bowler follows him. The striker got a good chunk of wood on the pull, but came second to a brilliant piece of fielding.",
