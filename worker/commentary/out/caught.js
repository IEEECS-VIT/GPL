    "whoa what a catch! You beauty! The batsman gets a faint edge as he waits on the back foot and the man at slip dives" +
    "  to his right to swoop it low with one hand.. Superb catch",
    "tries to cut this length ball over point, finds the man with a palpably mistimed shot",
    "very slow short ball, so he has to try and create his own momentum on the pull, but only manages to drag it tamely " +
    " to deep midwicket",
    "The fielder pulls out the chainsaw after clinging on to a flat, hard hit from him. It was full and the batsman  " +
    "moved his front leg to give himself room, he struck it well but has pinned down the man in the deep",
    "slower ball on off stump, he goes for a slog but doesn't connect well enough. Deep midwicket holds on to a straight" +
    "  forward catch",
    "overpitched just outside off, the batsman gets under it but hasn't gotten the elevation. Hits it hard and flat and " +
    " straight into the hands of long-on.",
    "tossed up on off stump, the batsman goes for the slog sweep. This has gained considerable height but there is a man" +
    "  in the deep. A fielder camps under it and holds on to a simple chance. Touches gloves with his partner as he " +
    "walks back",
    "he cannot believe he has top-edged such an innocuous delivery! It was short and sliding well down leg, should have " +
    " been pummeled over the fine leg boundary but instead the fielder runs back and takes a simple grab over his " +
    "shoulder. That should tell us something about the durability of his hands",
    "this is a blinder! The batsman whacks the short of length delivery to deep midwicket, where the fielder lines  " +
    "himself up for the catch.. but he slips.. Despite that, he somehow straightens his body on the ground, keeps an " +
    "eye on the ball, arches his body back and takes a catch sitting down.. freakish catch.",
    "and he's gone... ironically to a ball that he timed so well.. Probably his best connection of the day.. It was full" +
    "  and wide and he crashed it over point, but straight to deep point..the captain is pumped",
    "He is beaten by the extra bounce on this pitch.. the batsman wanted to clip it to the leg side, but this slower  " +
    "delivery got big on him and the leading edge just popped up for the cover fielder..",
    "tries to be cheeky but pays the price... He moves across the stumps to flick the full delivery fine, but only lobs" +
    "  it to short fine leg fielder",
    "how far has that gone! not too far unfortunately for the batsman. He made room, got a slower ball, lifted it towards" +
    "  deep midwicket and looked like he made a good connection... But that went straight into the bucket hands of the " +
    "fielder",
    "He tries to whack this inside out, with the spin, to the stands. The idea was right, the execution wasn't as he  " +
    "failed to get distance on this.. The catch is comfortably taken at deep extra cover",
    "tries to hammer the ball towards long-on, but he fares even worse. He could only get it as far as mid-off.",
    "that's the end of him as he slaps a length delivery straight to long-off. He didn't really time it as well as he " +
    " would have liked.",
    "leading edge to cover point now! Fuller on off, with some shape on it. He looks to play a loose push towards mid-on" +
    "  but closes the face too early. The fielder takes a simple catch",
    "he top-edges it to the man in the deep on the leg side",
    "shortish again and the batsman goes for a pull. Only succeeds in getting a top edge that soars into the night sky  " +
    "before settling in the hands of cover",
    "goes straight to long-off ! The bowler pulled his length back a little, the batsman still went after it. But he  " +
    "picked out the fielder. Punches his bat in disgust",
    "straight to long-off. The batsman chooses a very bad shot there as he looks to smite it down the ground. Gets it " +
    " off the bottom of the bat, which turns in his hands, and he controls a simple catch",
    "is forward and looks to clip through midwicket, closes the face too early and gets a leading edge that is pouched " +
    " by the bowler himself. Punches the air and screams in triumph",
    "slowed it up this time and the extra flight dupes him. The batsman doesn't hold back as he goes over the top again." +
    "  This time it's the leading edge that gains more height than distance. Long-off leaps up to hold down a pretty " +
    "good catch. Think he was very worried about the rope, but it was well behind him",
    "goes for the slog sweep and he's picked out the man in the deep! He had to drag a good length ball that went on  " +
    "with the arm, which hampers his timing and the man at deep square leg holds on easily",
    "he was looking to cut it into the gap behind point but the ball gained just a little more bounce and he steered it " +
    " straight into the hands of the square fielder",
    "he's picked out deep square leg, who hardly had to move! He looked quite dangerous skipping down the track and he " +
    " connected pretty cleanly as well. But he forgot all about the placement. A terribly soft dismissal considering the" +
    " situation",
    "the slower ball has him! It's not a short one though. The batsman backed away to flay the good length offcutter " +
    " through the off side and gets a thick outside edge that lobs to short third man. The fielder dives forward and " +
    "plucks a pretty neat take",
    "the batsman throws his head back! He's spliced a slower, back of a length ball down the throat of mid-off. He was " +
    " trying his best to make some room to lash it quite a bit squarer than where it ended up but the ball struck him a " +
    "little too high on the bat and he wasn't able to instill any power into the shot",
    "Three men were hunting down that catch, it was about to land just out of reach but he dives and sticks out both " +
    "hand  and plucks it out of it's trajectory! It was on a length but was hit it a little too high on the bat. It " +
    "was a very difficult skier somewhere beyond the circle in the midwicket region but he was quick enough and athletic" +
    " enough to pull it off",
    "full and slow delivery mishit over midwicket, a fielder runs across from long on and takes a tumbling catch",
    "he backs away, the delivery is angled in full and the batsman lifts it tamely to mid off",
    "this has gone miles in the air as the batsman steps out, is not to the pitch of one that straightens, but goes " +
    "through  with the shot, long off settles under it",
    "tried to fetch this short of a length ball from way outside off and flat-bat it down the ground but he has not got" +
    "  enough elevation on the mishit, mid off times his jump to take a sharp catch",
    "he keeps it on a good length, around off, the batsman tries to force it square on the leg side, misses and the " +
    " bowler hits off with slight away movement",
    "this has kicked up from just back of a length, the surprised batsman jabs at it and it pops tamely to point",
    "strikes early, length ball moving away outside off, the batsman stands and wafts, and feathers it behind",
    "full into leg stump, the batsman clears front leg, gets under it and lifts it straight to long on",
    "swats this full delivery flat and straight to long off! Brilliant judgement !",
    "and he's managed to hold on! The batsman swats a length ball to long off, he comes forward and across and takes it " +
    " quite safely",
    "slogs probably as hard as he can, but just fails to clear deep midwicket, where the fielder moves to his right to " +
    " take a well-judged catch very close to the rope",
    "he top-edges it to the man in the deep on the leg side",
    "played away from the body and he miscued it to long-off",
    "this was tossed up outside off and the batsman made room to carve that over cover, the fielder ran to his right at " +
    " cover and took the catch easily at the edge of the circle",
    "straight to deep midwicket, the batsman attempts to slog that for a six over deep midwicket, fetches it from outside " +
    " off, it went flat to the fielder,",
    "gets the line and length spot on this time! The away swinger gets him, swung away from the middle stump, the " +
    "batsman  was compelled to go for the drive, thick outside edge to the keeper",
    "made a lot of room and charged down the track looking to clear the off side, unfortunately he made too much room " +
    " and the ball spooned off the bottom of the bat, the fielder ran backwards at mid-off and hung on on the dive just " +
    "as the ball was leaving him, the fielder covered a lot of ground getting to the ball, amazing stuff",
    "has pulled off quite a stunner! The batsman looked to clear the straight boundary, it was high in the air and he " +
    " was running back from mid-off, the running catches are the toughest, hung on to it and fell backwards",
    "this time the fielder takes a terrific catch, the batsman has flopped, a length ball and he wanted to play that " +
    " inside-out, bat turns as he plays that and the ball loops towards cover, the fielder has some ground to cover, he " +
    "sprints to his left and pouches that one",
    "gets him with the slower ball, it was short and teh batsman swiveled and looked to pull it to fine leg, just shaved" +
    "  the face of the bat on the way to the keeper",
    "nearly spilled that! Slower ball and short, the batsman rocked back to pull and it was flat over square leg, the man" +
    "  in the deep ran to his left and grabbed at it, it popped out and he tried taking it in the second attempt and it " +
    "slipped out again but he managed in the third attempt",
    "this was a length ball and the batsman made room to clear long-on, he closed the face of the bat as he made contact" +
    "  and hence didn't hit it well enough",
    "this was a length ball, the batsman stayed at the crease and looked to clear long-on, didn't get the distance, the" +
    "  fielder takes the skier well in front of the rope",
    "he mishits this full delivery, it goes straight and high, stays airborne for an age, but long on judges it neatly",
    "this is a sharp, tumbling take at deep backward square leg, the batsman swung a short of a length ball and the  " +
    "fielder has not had to move much",
    "the batsman sees deep point, and he will take him on of course, slices this widish back of a length ball straight " +
    " to the man.",
    "advances out to a flat one and lifts it straight into the hands of deep midwicket",
    "he slashes this short of a length ball in the air and straight to third man",
    "The bowler cranks it up on this ball, the batsman turns on one leg, trying to lift it over square leg, but he is " +
    "not  so lucky this time, loops straight to the man",
    "this is outside off now, the batsman gets down on his knee and swings, and inside-edges it into his stumps",
    "finds deep midwicket this time, it was shortish, angled in, right in the pulling zone, he swung it from outside " +
    "the  crease, and into the safe hands of long on",
    "and the plan has worked to perfection, he gets a back of a length ball down the pad, around hip height, tucks it " +
    " fine instinctively, and there is a leg slip waiting to accept the gift",
    "terrific delivery, the bowler leaps as this one kicks from just back of a length around off, straightens on the " +
    " batsman, he has to play at this, prods, and the thick edge flies low to widish slip",
    "Nothing behind this shot. Caught at long-on",
    "gets a touch too under a length ball, lofts this towards long-off where th fielder takes it overhead",
    "This is a slower-ball length ball hit wide of long-off, but the fielder makes so much ground he doesn't even have " +
    " to dive.",
    "pitches this up on middle and leg, drilled to long-on where the fielder times his leap to perfection to take this " +
    " overhead",
    "on a length, just outside off, he lazily drives into it. Makes no attempt to keep it down, nor is he trying to hit " +
    " it out of the ground. Provides long-off a sitter.",
    "He is hurried into this shovel-pull. Mostly because the ball is not short enough, and he ends up slicing it to  " +
    "square leg",
    "he can't believe what he's done, he turns back to the umpire and waits for the crooked finger, this was pitched up " +
    " on the off stump, just the right length, the batsman comes forward and there's a thick outside edge to the keeper," +
    " it was very obvious, the bowler waits and waits and the umpire does the rest",
    "that was a soft dismissal! This was a length ball outside off and the batsman looked to clear mid-off but it went " +
    " off the bottom half of the bat and as a result it went rather tamely to mid-off",
    "finds the fielder at long-on, makes room and it's mistimed and it is taken at long-on",
    "This was a length ball and he made room to smash this over the off side, top edge and the keeper gets under the skier",
    "this was a friendly full toss, whipped it straight to deep midwicket",
    "finds the man in the deep on the on side, this was a slower ball and bowled a bit short, Warner rocks back and " +
    "pulls  in front of square but finds the man at deep midwicket, went straight to him",
    "found the fielder with precision, the batsman was down on his knee to slog, played it flat and found the fielder " +
    " at deep square leg",
    "that's a soft dismissal! But that wasn't a terribly good delivery either, this was short and wide outside off, the " +
    " invitation was there for the cut but he could only hit it straight to the man at cover, didn't time it well and " +
    "an easy catch in the end",
    "pushed through on middle and leg as he rocks back and goes for an almighty pull. Hasn't connected it properly and " +
    " the fielder at deep midwicket takes a tumbling catch to break the opposition's partnership",
    " one slog too many for the batsman and he has to walk back dismissed off a full toss. Sought the wide yorker again " +
    " but it ends up a lovely delivery to be smacked over the covers but he swung across the line and got a leading edge" +
    " which is taken by the man in the covers",
    "scooped it straight into the hands of the man at short fine leg. It did not allow the batsman the pace he wanted. " +
    " Walked right across his stumps to manufacture a big shot and perishes",
    "holes out at long-off ! Another full toss outside off but the batsman can't get the meaty part of the bat on this. " +
    " Lofts it down the throat of the fielder",
    "safely taken! The batsman was lured into playing an expansive drive on the up and he was an age too early into the " +
    " shot. Gets a leading edge and perishes in quite a tame fashion",
    "taken at long-off! This was full on middle and the batsman made a little room to blast it down the ground. Didn't " +
    " get as much bat as he would have liked as the fielder rushes in and dives forward to pick up a neat, low catch! " +
    "That was plucked inches off the ground.",
    "caught at the edge of the circle at cover! Fuller delivery on off stump and the batsman tries to force the pace by " +
    " shoveling it over the infield. The ball was too full to get under as well as he would have liked.",
    "goes straight up in the air and the bowler himself takes the catch, albeit after a bit of a juggle. ",
    "what a soft dismissal, caught down the leg side! The captain high-fives his bowler. The batsman shuffled across to " +
    "  try and glance it fine but the ball, just short of a good length, runs off the face and the keeper collects " +
    "another simple catch",
    "a shortish ball down the leg side, wasn't the most threatening delivery, the batsman wanted to pull that away, " +
    "can only glove it away, easy catch for the keeper",
    "slower ball on off stump, he goes for a slog but doesn't connect well enough. the fielder is at deep midwicket " +
    "and holds on to a straight forward catch",
    "pulls out the chainsaw after clinging on to a flat, hard hit from the batsman. The bowler is on a roll here. It " +
    "was full and he moved his front leg to give himself room, he struck it well but has pinned down the man in the deep",
    "tossed up on off stump, the batsman goes for the slog sweep. This has gained considerable height but there is a " +
    "man in the deep. A fielder camps under it and holds on to a simple chance. Touches gloves with his partner as he " +
    "walks back",
    "overpitched just outside off, the batsman gets under it but hasn't gotten the elevation. Hits it hard and flat " +
    "and straight into the hands of the man at long-on.",
    "charges at the bowler who pulls the length back, and the top edge flies over the keeper's head. The slip runs " +
    "back to take an easy catch",
    "short ball, he has sent it straight down the throat of deep midwicket. The bowler plays a part in yet another " +
    "wicket. Just one of those shots, though. The ball deserves to be hit, but it has perhaps skidded on to him, and " +
    "he is hurried into the pull. Easy catch for the man at deep midwicket",
    "it is a goodie from the man in the deep. THe batsman backs away again to go over extra, but is cramped up this " +
    "time, which means he ends up hitting it mush straighter than he wants to. The fielder camps on the fence, and " +
    "takes this coolly overhead",
    "It's onto the batsman quicker than he expected. He was in an uncomfortable half-forward position, no position " +
    "from which to pull - it wasn't short enough for that either - and he top-edged it high in the air, simple catch " +
    "for the man at deep square leg",
    "down the track now, doesn't reach the pitch, and he picks out that man again. The bowler tossed it up slower and " +
    "wider, and Tare had to reach out in front of his body to hit that, ended up hitting it straight down long-off's " +
    "throat",
    "the captain had two slips in place, and the batsman has steered this one straight into first ones hands. Back of " +
    "a length outside off, left the batsman off the pitch. Simply poked at it with an open face, a nothing shot, and " +
    "it flew off the outside half of the bat and into the fielder's palms at a comfortable chest height",
    "he never looked comfortable against him, trying to manufacture shots. Yet again he tries a shot that is not on. " +
    "Looks to go over mid-on, but this length ball is too close to him, and he has sent this straight down mid-on's throat.",
    "He tries one shot too many. The bowler has run his fingers on this. Slightly off-pace with another forceful shot, " +
    "and he is early into it. The outside edge is pouched by the keeper",
    "this is not the smartest bit of batting. He has fallen to an old little trap from the skipper. More experienced " +
    "batsmen do better. The captain has guessed that off side is his game, and has placed a deep point and opened the " +
    "third man region. The next three balls: a slog into the leg side, an attempt to open the face, and another slog. " +
    "This slog goes a mile in the air and settles with the man at extra cover. You have got to make them work harder " +
    "for your wickets",
    "soft. Softest ever. Any softer and it would be molten wax. He looks like Duncan Fletcher giving catching practice " +
    "to the slips and point. Just opens the face on a short and wide ball to give point an easy catch",
    "he is not looking at the ball as he pulls. There has been a plan to bowl at his head, he has managed to keep it " +
    "down twice, but this time he is late into the pull. The head falls away, he is not looking at it, and the ball " +
    "comes and hits the bat as opposed to the hat hitting the ball. Easy catch for midwicket",
    "slogs, mis-hits a length ball, he top-edges it to deep midwicket, and the striker has done half his job of getting" +
    " off strike, but has managed no run off it. Easy catch for deep midwicket",
    "strikes early. The batsman perishes. He races down the track, manufactures a length ball, skews it off the bottom" +
    " of the bat. That is a dolly for mid-off as the batsman makes a hash of the lofted stroke",
    "and he has nicked off! THe bowler is on a roll #like a boss. This was a teasing fullish ball sliding outside off," +
    " the batsman is lured into pushing at it and the outside edge is held by the keeper",
    "and the bowler takes down his man! This was dragged short and wide outside off, so he seeks to pull it away. He " +
    "has to settle with a thick top-edge. Straight down the gullet of deep third man ( not literally). Eys hopeful, he " +
    "looks back at the umpire and waits as the umpires check for a possible no-ball. It is a legal delivery and his " +
    "knock has been cut short",
    "in the action again, this time pulling off a smart-looking catch. Full toss around the leg-stump line, he goes " +
    "down on one knee, but does not get enough power behind the slog-sweep. Holes out to long-on. He snapped it, " +
    "realised that he was close to the ad boards, and then regained his balance and pouched it on the rebound. The " +
    "second grab does it for him in the end.",
    "and he's gone! The bowler delivers the customary early breakthrough. The coaching outfit look pleased in the " +
    "dug-out. This was full and sliding across, who chases it only to nick it through. The outside edge is well " +
    "held by Sanju, diving across to his right.",
    "the fielder completes a superb catch. He backed away and aimed to smash this back of a length ball away over" +
    " the off side, but does not get hold of it. Mid-off moves to his left, dives and snaffles the take",
    "and he finally has a wicket! This one lifts from a length outside off, the batsman looks to go over the leg " +
    "side. His crude heave translates into a leading edge, which is swallowed by deep third man after running to his " +
    "right",
    "perishes after being hoodwinked by the bowler's change of pace. Oh wait, the umpires are checking for a " +
    "possible no-ball. He may have had some part of his heel behind the bowling crease. Aims to go big and holes out to " +
    "long-off",
    "what an insane catch! Superb tag-team work from the bowling team. What presence of mind. The fielding has " +
    "veered from ordinary to extraordinary tonight. This is an extraordinary assisted hokey-pokey catch. On a length " +
    "and on the leg stump, the batsman attacks it and sends it over midwicket. The fielder leaps, plucks out his right hand" +
    " and takes it. But his balance is awry as he looks to go over the ad boards. However, he has the presence of mind" +
    " to tag it to a nearby fielder, who dives across and pouches it",
    "and the batsman picks out cover now. Good catch st long on, for it was travelling at the rate of knots. Too " +
    "full and outside off, he flays a drive. The fielder hops up and cover and takes it around chest-height. Ouch, that" +
    " must sting.",
    "in the air and the catch is taken, at long on! The batsman slapped the short ball from outside off down the " +
    "ground. The ball was in the air for some time and became an easy catch for long on",
    "it's high, it's not off the middle of the bat, and he's taken at deep midwicket. The batsman slog-sweeps the " +
    "fullish delivery from middle and leg, it goes high enough for the fielder to take it easy in the deep",
    "not long before he targets that leg-side boundary, but he's caught in the deep! He went back in the crease to " +
    "whip that short of length ball to the long-leg boundary, gets some distance but long leg takes it right at the" +
    " boundary. The bowler roars, he has some whiskers too",
    "that goes high and straight down the ground, a fielder runs to his left from long on and takes a good catch on" +
    " the move. Back of length it was, our culprit slogged to the leg side and got a leading edge",
    "loud appeal for a catch down leg and the finger's gone up, he is gone! Good pace and bounce for the short ball" +
    " as it was going down leg, he pulled, got some glove before the keeper took a good catch",
    "the bowler strikes! The slower ball works for him. Too full and wide outside off, perhaps, looks to loft-drive" +
    " it over the infield. But ends up slicing it to backward point. Undone by the slow off-cutter",
    "runs down the track but mis-hits the lofted stroke, holes out to long-off, who follows the ball, watches it all" +
    " along and pouches it safely",
    "holed out to deep midwicket, where the fielder leaps near the boundary and completes a sharp catch. Short and on" +
    " the leg stump as the batsman backs away and the bowler follows him. The striker got a good chunk of wood on the " +
    "pull, but came second to a brilliant piece of fielding.",
    "and he strikes, the hitting effort has been cut short. Pushed through quicker on off, looks like it went with the" +
    " angle. The batsman steps out, does not get hold of the lofted-hit, skews it in the air. The diving ball settles " +
    "under floodlit skies at long-on.",
    "and he is gone now! This was flat and quick on off, he aims to slog it away from there. Low-percentage cross-bat" +
    " swipe. Miscues it to deep midwicket",
    "perishes now. Arm-ball flat and quick on middle and leg, the striker seeks to pull it away. Not a full-blooded one," +
    " not all that well-timed, neither did he impart power to it. A fielder snaps it up at deep backward square",
    "bat undone by leather.. The umpires check for a possible no-ball, just a customary check, all fine though. Slipper" +
    " delivery sprayed wide outside off, the batsman wants to attack it, but can only edge it thickly to his left. " +
    "Might have been the change of pace, there.",
    "Where is the keeper? Fuller and straighter, the batsman picks it up from there and whips it straight down the " +
    "gullet of deep midwicket. Simple catch for the man there. The off-speed ball pulled the wool over him and the " +
    "bowler exults",
    "He nips down the track, the bowler is smart enough to shorten his length. The ball hits the splice of the bat as " +
    "opposed to the bat hitting the ball. Spoons it through to the fielder at the covers, he moves to his left and " +
    "grasps it. The bowler is pumped after drawing the error from the batsman",
    "he has to depart now. This was short and sliding across the batsman, who had initially made room to go over the " +
    "covers. He makes a meal of the shot and nicks it through to the man behind the stumps. Poor, poor batting this. " +
    "The keeper takes it at head height",
    "the bowler gives this some air, the batsman aims to loft it away and holes out to the man at long-off. Definition" +
    " of a dolly. He skied it off the base of the bat",
    "On a length and outside off, carved into the hands of deep point",
    "the slower ball has worked, he has given a catch to mid off! He made some room for the length delivery, wanted to " +
    "smash it down the ground and mistimed it for a high catch as mid-off came under it comfortably",
    "gets a top edge and the fielder takes a spectacular running catch at deep backward square leg to get this wicket! " +
    "He pulled the short ball, got a top edge and it went pretty high. The fielder had to run a long way to his right, " +
    "another was also coming from deep midwicket but he got both hands to it in time",
    "straight to deep midwicket, he didn't have to move an inch! Pressure seemed to have got to him as he played a " +
    "cross-bat slog to the length delivery and found the man in the deep",
    "Pitched it up just outside off, Smith came down again and looks like he didn't pick that one, lofted it down the " +
    "ground and found long on",
    "he's stumped! An unwanted shot charged again for the widish delivery and missed it completely as it came in. Easy " +
    "work for the keeper",
    "Pitched on length outside off and moving in sharply, the batsman hardly moves his feet and was trapped right in " +
    "front of middle and leg, that was plumb",
    "holed out, he gets him with a long hop! It was short and flat, the batsman smashed it to the leg side and found " +
    "long on.",
    "he swings and finds the man at deep backward square. This was on the pads, the batsman picks it up and hits it " +
    "right into the palms of the man in the deep. Simple catch, he did not even have to budge.",
    "strikes to get rid of the striker! Pushed through flat and quick on middle, the batsman hunts for a slog-sweep " +
    "after going down on one knee. Gets a top-edge and shoots it up in the air. A fielder comes forward from point and " +
    "pouches it",
    "and he pulls off a stunner! One-handed... This was fuller and on middle, looks like a gripper. The batsman wants " +
    "to clip it away to the leg and loops it into the air off a leading edge. The fielder flies to his right from short" +
    " cover, both feet off the ground, and plucks it out one-handed. Whoa.",
    "Caught at sweeper cover. This was on a length and outside off, he slices it high into the air. A fielder settles" +
    " under it at sweeper cover. More off the toe-end of the bat, that",
    "Short and wide outside off, he steps away, winds up for a big blow and skews it to the air. The man at covers " +
    "moves to his left and collects it",
    "Banged in short and rises awkwardly on the batsman, who goes for the pull. He can only splice it in the air. The" +
    " man at cow corner rushes in and completes a smart catch at midwicket. He tumbles onto the ground after taking it",
    "has had one leading edge too many, wanted to work a length ball off the pad, ended up hitting it high and limply " +
    "to mid off",
    "he has picked out long off, skipped out and went with the spin, but was not too close to the pitch and did not get" +
    " the distance",
    "strikes with a slower one, the batsman tried to make some room and loft it over extra cover, but badly mishit it, and" +
    " it is an easy catch at mid off",
    "and now he strikes, he kept moving the line across the batsman, this one was floated up outside off, moved away a" +
    " tad, he pushed at it away from the body, and the lone slip was in business",
    "could have been a flicked six but he could not get enough distance on this full one and deep midwicket tumbles " +
    "forward to take it",
    "Cross-seamer from the bowler. Shortish and rushes on outside off to ruin the attempted pull. He lobs it up in the " +
    "air, a fielder runs across to his right from mid-off, dives and snags a smart catch",
    "and he has holed out, no more hitting for him! This was pushed across him, he aims to loft it straight down the " +
    "ground. But does not connect properly, slices it high into the air. The man makes good ground from deep cover, " +
    "runs across and snaffles the take",
    "outside off and he strikes! The batsman runs down the track, seeks to smash another mighty blow. But has to " +
    "settle with a slice, which is swallowed up by the fielder at the covers",
    "and the bowler is delighted. The batsman chips down the track, does not middle the lofted strike. The fielder " +
    "just about hangs onto it at long-on",
    "and he takes a sharp catch. The batsman wants to whack it over the leg side, skews it off the bottom of the bat " +
    "and holes out to long-off, where the fielder takes it at the edge of the boundary",
    "banged in short and rushes onto tuck him up for room. He was caught between pulling and pulling out of the stroke," +
    " gets into an awkward tangle and guides it to the fielder at deep third man off the bottom part of the bat",
    "goes deep in the crease, but holes out. This was very full from the bowler on off, the batsman shuffles across " +
    "a bit, goes deep in the crease and swings it. He runs in from midwicket, keeps his eyes on the ball, dives " +
    "forward and pulls off a superb catch. The umpires check for a no-ball and the delivery is okay, the batsman has to go",
    "This was pushed through, the striker aims to swipe it away. Does not get it off the meat of the bat. Skies it " +
    "off a top-edge, which is held by the man at cover",
    "And the bowler strikes, good retort. This one rears up from a back of a length and slides across the batsman with " +
    "the angle. He has a loose waft at it and edges it through to the keeper, who moves to his left to pouch that.",
    "delivers the breakthrough, the batsman has given it away. Fuller and outside off, he opens his bat-face and looks " +
    "to steer through vacant slip, who dives to his right and plucks a smart one-handed catch. The umpire check for a " +
    "no-ball, which is okay, the catch is also clean.",
    "he picks out short cover perfectly! The bowler floats this outside off, he goes hard on the drive but cracks it " +
    "straight to the man at short cover",
    "how does he always take such catches?! This ball he did not middle, pulled the back of length ball down the ground, " +
    "got a leading edge right over the bowler's head and he ran from mid off to his left to dive backwards and catch it " +
    "as if that's what he does every morning after waking up",
    "and he is gone too, another catch down the ground! Made some room, maybe the bowler anticipated it and pitched " +
    "outside off, the batsman swung his arms wildly, didn't middle it and found the fielder for a simple catch at the " +
    "edge of the circle",
    "the ball finds a fielder! Short of length ball towards the stumps, the batsman cleared his front foot and threw " +
    "his bat at it, got a leading edge and the fielder ran a few steps to his right from fly slip for an easy catch",
    "and out! Slower through the air and angled in, he slams it down the ground and finds long on for an easy catch",
    "slower ball brings the fall! He picked the ball from around off, it was fullish, to the leg side and the fielder " +
    "took a simple catch around his left shoulder at deep midwicket",
    "full toss gets a wicket now! Attempted yorker is a full toss on the pads, he flicks it in the air and deep backward " +
    "square leg takes a straightforward catch.",
    "straight down long-off's throat! He came down the track to take it on the full, did not succeed, and mistimed " +
    "that one down to the fielder's throat for an easy one",
    "another mistimed shot, another wicket! This was flat and well outside off, but still slog-swept to the leg side, " +
    "got a top edge very high and took the catch going back a few steps from midwicket",
    "there we go! Lovely line just outside off and he was tempted by third man a bit too much. Flashed the angled blade " +
    "and presents slip-catching practice to a diving widish first slip",
    "done him in! He seemed to be tiring to be lazy in the shot here. Fooled by the slower ball that holds on the pitch." +
    " Was into his slog way too early and the leading edge settles into the hands of cover. Canny bowling here",
    "what a catch! This was a long hop that was sailing beyond the midwicket boundary, but he waits for it. He times " +
    "his jump with insane precision and thrusts his hands over head and grabs a stunner with the boundary inches from " +
    "his feet as he comes down! Boy, is he pumped!",
    "how soft was that? This was back of a length and comes in on middle and leg, he aims to flick it away. Instead he " +
    "chips it to short midwicket. This may have stuck in the pitch and stopped on him. He rehearses the flick as he " +
    "walks back",
    "He takes pride in calling keeping his primary skill and he shows it off. This looked like one that " +
    "gripped in the pitch, did not come onto the batsman, bounced extra as well. He looks to guide it away through the " +
    "slip cordon but makes a mess of it. Off the face of the bat and pouched by the keeper, diving across full-length " +
    "to his right. End of a charming cameo from this player. Replays show that it was the back-of-the-hand slower one",
    "flashes, connects and nicks off. This was on a length and angling away outside off again, he swishes and manages " +
    "a bottom-edge, which is gobbled up easily by the keeper",
    "he's taken a super catch diving forward! The bowler waits after shovelling the wide, tossed up through the off side." +
    " But the fielder swooped in from point, threw himself forward and to his right and takes a lovely grab. Third " +
    "umpire confirms and off he goes.",
    "picks out long-off! Easily done by the bowler. It was overpitched, but was wide. Had to reach out for it and that " +
    "ruins his timing. The striker went through with the stroke and pays for it",
    "caught at long-off! He was clearing that front leg again and the bowler bowls it full and wide to try and evade " +
    "his reach. Splices it off the bottom of the bat and  was easily under it",
    "he perishes! Back of a length and on middle and leg, the batsman chips it feebly, a fielder runs forward from " +
    "midwicket and completes a good catch. The extra lift from this delivery foiled the stroke",
    "strikes! On the customary back-of-a-length side, the striker hunts for another pull. This was not all that short " +
    "to warrant the stroke. He can't connect well this time, much like the first attempt. Gets a bottom-edge onto the " +
    "thigh, rebounds to the man at a widish slip position",
    "sharp work from the bowler! The batsman wants to whip this length ball on middle and leg away, does so. But the " +
    "fielder dives to his right at square leg and pulls off a smart, low catch",
    "and this time the batter has holed out, he pulls off a stunning catch, diving forward from sweeper. The batsman " +
    "makes room and carves it in the air, the fielder runs forward, takes the flat hit and tumbles onto the ground. The " +
    "batsman examines the bottom of the bat as he trudges back",
    "Crucial strike. The bowler delivers another short bumpy ball, the batsman backs away and mishits the attempted " +
    "cut, finds backward point. He hops up and takes it",
    "This was fuller and on middle, whipped away straight down the gullet of long-on. Not middled, hit high on the bat " +
    "and he holes out",
    "He bends down for a massive slog-sweep over leg, but can only skew it to long-off off the base of the bat.",
    "hey hustle for a couple, fine throw from long off, the keeper whips the bails off. This low full toss was drilled " +
    "down the ground. He wants a couple, the fielder collects the ball quickly from long-off and fires a throw to the " +
    "keeper. He moves to his left, gathers it on the second bounce and catches the batsman short",
    "this is an outstanding catch! The striker misses the yorker outside off, ends up bowling a full toss. Below the " +
    "waistline, though, the TV umpire confirms it as well. The batsman backs away and slices it. The bowler leaps " +
    "across to his left from backward point and completes a memorable catch. He also intercepted a four there",
    "the danger man is gone off the top edge, the crowd is happy, flags are waving! He shuffled across a long way to " +
    "off, swept the length delivery against the turn and got a top edge high in the air behind the keeper fine on leg. " +
    "The fielder went to his right from short fine leg to take it nicely",
    "can't clear the fielder this time and finds long off! Swept the fullish ball straight down the ground, not quite " +
    "from the middle, and holed out!",
    "The fielder has taken a very good catch at deep midwicket, the batsman is gone. He saw the short of length " +
    "delivery and played a half-flick-half-pull to the leg side, and the man had to jump in the deep to catch it over " +
    "his head",
    "slightly similar, slightly different, same result in similar fashion! Back of length ball coming in, lofted to the" +
    " leg side and he runs in this time to catch it easily",
    "holes out straight to sweeper cover! Short and wide, there's an opportunity to swing his arms, he does, and finds " +
    "the man in the deep",
    "chipped in the air and he takes a very good catch running in from mid off, the bowler gets a breakthrough! It was " +
    "fullish on off, he looked to play it down the ground but played it early and the ball lobbed towards mid-off, who " +
    "ran in and dived forward to get his fingers under it",
    "he holes out, is that the beginning of the end? Full delivery on the stumps, He put his back foot in the crease " +
    "and tonked it straight down to long-on",
    "he has missed him previously, but he has his man now! The batsman looks to pull this flatter delivery over " +
    "midwicket but gets hurried by the ball, doesn't get it off the middle and lobs an easy chance to mid-on",
    "that's the end of him, the extra bounce does it. The bowler slants it across the batsman at good pace and the " +
    "batsman looks to steer it to third man. But this is too close and he feathers an edge to the keeper",
    "another one goes down! Superb catch by the man at long-off. The striker looked to attack the flighted delivery " +
    "and almost beats the fielder, who is a bit inside the boundary and has to leap up to grab that one. He falls " +
    "backwards, but safely inside the boundary",
    "shortish ball, too quick for the batsman to pull, hurries through, and he top-edges it high in the air for the " +
    "fielder to take a sprawling catch at long leg",
    "full outside off, and he picks out backward point. Makes room to slice it away, hits it fairly well, but straight " +
    "to the fielder, who catches it just above head height",
    "taken! That was full and wide and he had a big slog at it, got a thick outside edge that was going a long way to " +
    "the right of the keeper, but he dived across, at full stretch, and came away with the ball in his right glove",
    "fullish outside off, and he simply doesn't time that. Looked to hit it over mid-off, and I think that hit the " +
    "outside half of his bat, and he ended up chipping it straight to mid-off",
    "short outside off, and he has simply helped that into third man's hands. Leaned back to ramp it, and picked out " +
    "the fielder",
    "shortish outside off and he's gone! Looked for that late dab again, ended up sending a thin edge into the keeper's " +
    "gloves",
    "It was a long-hop, or a longish-hop at any rate, and he pulls it straight down the throat of deep midwicket",
    "slower ball slanting away from off stump, and the keeper takes a good low catch to his right, after the batsman " +
    "looked to slog it over the leg side and only managed a top-edge",
    "got him! That was cleanly struck, clearing his front leg and hitting the full middle-stump ball down the ground, " +
    "but didn't get enough elevation to clear long-on, who timed his jump perfectly to catch it two-handed, over his " +
    "head",
    "and he strikes. Very full on middle and leg. The striker looks to hoick it away over the leg side, doesn't really " +
    "get hold of it, picks out deep square leg",
    "goes for the slog-sweep now and he's holed out to deep midwicket. Just a bit of extra bounce from middle and leg " +
    "and it produces the top edge",
    "loopy delivery, and that's produced the breakthrough. Nice line from the bowler, challenged to hit him against the " +
    "angle, and he top-edged the attempted slog-sweep high in the air, drops into the waiting hands of long-on",
    "full and wide outside off, and the striker gets under it and slices it straight into sweeper cover's hands.",
    "gone this time, his preferred back of a length doing it, the striker did not seem to be sure about the pull as he " +
    "took it from outside off, awkwardly top-edged it behind square on leg, the keeper got under it safely",
    "catching practice for extra cover and the batsman has squeezed a full one straight to the man",
    "quite full now, and he has drilled it straight to the man at long on, how much has he hurt their chances?",
    "you beauty!!! He keeps ta king this shoulder-breaking catches in almost every game. This is a top-edge as the " +
    "batsman looks to hit down the ground and it looks like well clear of mid-off, but the fielder back pedals and " +
    "somehow gets under it just in time.. Falls backwards hard on that right shoulder. Just saw on the replay.. this is " +
    "a one-hander.. doubly impressive then",
    "that's a spectacular catch, and what a celebration! Back of length slower ball towards off stump, the batter " +
    "lofted it down the ground, it didn't go that high but he ran in from long on and threw himself forward to get his " +
    "fingers under it. Then he gets up, raises his right hand and leg simultaneously, then the left ones for a little " +
    "jig. All in slow motion",
    "right from the middle of the bat, but he finds deep midwicket. Went down on a knee for the ball outside off, swept " +
    "it against the angle and holed out, who was a good few yards inside the rope",
    "gets a wicket immediately, the big one! Landed a full delivery on the pads, he launched it high on the leg side " +
    "with a flick, he was there right at the midwicket boundary at the edge and caught it over his head on the right " +
    "side. Very well judged",
    "another one falls, another nail hammered by the bowler! The striker pulls this ball, it was a short one, but " +
    "manages only a top edge down the ground. It's gone high enough for the fielder to run behind the umpire form mid " +
    "off, he catches it and does a little Calypso jig",
    "threw his bat at this one outside off, get a leading edge and he ran in from deep cover to take the catch",
    "cuts it to point, gone! Delivered this one slower outside off, it went the other way and the batsman went back in " +
    "the crease to cut it off the middle. He takes a good, low catch towards his left there",
    "edged and gone! This was touch back of length outside off, Smith poked trying to steer it to third man but found a " +
    "thick outside edge and the keeper pouches it with both hands to his right",
    "can't clear the fielder this time, holes out to long off! He charged down, as usual, chipped the ball down the " +
    "ground with power, but it didn't have enough to clear long off",
    "mistimes, and gone! He came outside the crease, couldn't take it on the full and lofted it outside off, didn't " +
    "middle it at all and found sweeper cover",
    "in the arc, but not out of the park even though it looked like he middled it. Fulish around off, lofted between " +
    "long on and deep midwicket, but it's gone high enough for long on to get under it",
    "you can give them to this guy and he'll gobble them. Pitched up around off, it was slow again, and he looked to " +
    "loft it over the covers but mistimed it straight down the ground, high in the air. Th fielder comes from long on " +
    "and catches it safely",
    "makes room for the slower ball on the stumps, it's absolutely full and he slices it straight to short third man",
    "they finally take a catch, the batsman did well to move across, lean forward and flick this full delivery from " +
    "around off, but straight into the hands of short fine leg",
    "failed to clear long on, seemed as if he had got more than enough on this full one as he sent it climbing into the " +
