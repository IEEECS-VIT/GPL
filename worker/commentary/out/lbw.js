    "The batsman had no clue about this ball.. He played back to it and was hit right in front.",
    "This was the one that went in and the batsman looked to work it away on the leg side, got hit right in front of " +
    "the  middle stump.. Easy decision for the umpire",
    "gone! This is full, fast and hitting middle and leg stump. The batsman is too slow to bring his bat down and is  " +
    "caught plumb in front. He falls over as he tries to flick it",
    "The lack of pace accounts for him this time!",
    "Pitched on middle and leg, the ball skidded through and went on straight, the batsman was trapped on the back foot " +
    " and plumb in front",
    "The lack of pace accounts for him this time!",
    "Absolutely supreme ! The ball pitched just on the off stump line, moving that fraction of  a fraction inwards to  " +
    "flummox the batsman,   who gets confused and offers no shot, only to find the umpire's raised finger, signalling " +
    "his doom.",
    "what just happened here ? What would have otherwise been a straightforward delivery on middle stump has been made " +
    " to look like a monster ball.   The batsman tries a switch hit, only he manages to mess it up completely. The ball " +
    "hit him low on the pads, he's a dead man.",
    "The umpire needed no technological assistance for this, it was as plumb as it can possibly be. Pitched on off stump," +
    "  didn't bounce as much as the batsman would have liked, and he walks off with his tail between his legs.",
    "That's struck him in front ! The bowler is in ecstasy, doesn't even wait for the umpire's signal.",
    "that's gone, the bowler tries a reverse paddle, misses this big time and is caught in front",
    "This bowler needs only balls to strike, he has the batsman lbw, it was a delayed appeal for lbw, that was a back of" +
    "  length ball around off stump, the batsman tries to whip that away, pad first,   a bit of doubt over whether that " +
    "would have hit off, the umpire is convinced though",
    "trapped in the crease and he has to trudge back. No doubt about this one. This came on and struck him on the back  " +
    "pad as he was looking to clip to midwicket.   The ball skids on and he's a goner",
    "it's given! That's a pretty tight call from the umpire and the batsman walks back looking a little bemused. It " +
    "pitched  in line and went on with the arm as he went for a sweep.   Struck low on the front pad and it might just " +
    "have grazed off stump.",
    "skiddy ball and he's out lbw. pretty straight, and just short of a length, and it skids through to beat him and " +
    "trap him in front. Height is the only issue, but the umpire has raised his finger",
    "and this is a lovely bouncer. He has been mis-hit in the past, but this is aimed right at the melon. The batsman " +
    "backs away, and is in no position to pull. Manages a massive edge that settles with mid-off",
    "belts out an lbw appeal and forefinger goes up. The striker departs! This one lifts from a length on off, He plays " +
    "down the wrong line and does not meet with the flick as he is rapped on the knee-roll. It may have just bounced over" +
    " the stumps. Not too sure",
    "superb delivery. This is beautifully bowled! It pitches on a length outside off and jags back in sharply, enough to" +
    " beat the inside edge of the bat and strike him on the back pad. The umpire waits for a bit before raising his " +
    "finger. The batsman was looking to play it to the leg side but did not account for the movement.",
    "This stand has been broken, courtesy some sharp bowling. The captain is pumped. This was floated on middle, the " +
    "batsman goes low for a sweep but misses and is struck on the back pad. The umpire raises his forefinger",
    "This was fuller jags in and on middle, he seeks to flick it across the line but misses his stroke, he is struck " +
    "on the pad, well below the knee roll. The batsman was crease-bound there and pays the penalty That would have " +
    "smacked into middle and leg and given!",
    "and he gets his man now! He is elated and his hands aloft in joy. This one skids off the deck on middle, might " +
    "have been the slippery one. The striker misses the reverse sweep and the umpire raises his forefinger",
    "the bowler has struck when it mattered! This one was angling in from leg stump, the batsman looked to glance it " +
    "off the pads but could not connect and was struck in front of leg. Finger went up in no time even though it wasn't " +
    "really plumb",
    "this ball pins him lbw. This was fullish and on off, The batsman shuffles across off and does not meet with the " +
    "flick, rapped on the front pad. Struck in front of off and he has to depart. He exults",
    "in-ducker does the trick again. This was on a good length and comes in on off, the batsman aims for an across-the-line" +
    " flick and misses, plumb in front. Oh wait, replays reveal that he had gotten an inside-snick on to front pad. " +
    "Unfortunate..",
    "full-toss on middle and leg, and he's lbw. Swivelled to pull and it smacked him flush on the thigh pad. Was on its " +
    "way down when it struck him.",
    "the slower delivery works, he is gone! It was an offcutter coming in from outside off, he moved across to help it " +
    "to leg but could not connect and was trapped in front of middle stump"
