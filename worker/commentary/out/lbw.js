        "gone! This is full, fast and hitting middle and leg stump. The batsman is too slow to bring his bat down and is  " +
        "caught plumb in front. He falls over as he tries to flick it",
        "The lack of pace accounts for him this time!",
        "Pitched on middle and leg, the ball skidded through and went on straight, the batsman was trapped on the back foot " +
        " and plumb in front",
        "The lack of pace accounts for him this time!",
        "Absolutely supreme ! The ball pitched just on the off stump line, moving that fraction of  a fraction inwards to  " +
        "flummox the batsman,   who gets confused and offers no shot, only to find the umpire's raised finger, signalling " +
        "his doom.",
        "what just happened here ? What would have otherwise been a straightforward delivery on middle stump has been made " +
        " to look like a monster ball.   The batsman tries a switch hit, only he manages to mess it up completely. The ball " +
        "hit him low on the pads, he's a dead man.",
        "The umpire needed no technological assistance for this, it was as plumb as it can possibly be. Pitched on off stump," +
        "  didn't bounce as much as the batsman would have liked, and he walks off with his tail between his legs.",
        "That's struck him in front ! The bowler is in ecstasy, doesn't even wait for the umpire's signal.",
        "that's gone, the bowler tries a reverse paddle, misses this big time and is caught in front",
        "This bowler needs only balls to strike, he has the batsman lbw, it was a delayed appeal for lbw, that was a back of" +
        "  length ball around off stump, the batsman tries to whip that away, pad first,   a bit of doubt over whether that " +
        "would have hit off, the umpire is convinced though",
        "trapped in the crease and he has to trudge back. No doubt about this one. This came on and struck him on the back  " +
        "pad as he was looking to clip to midwicket.   The ball skids on and he's a goner",
        "it's given! That's a pretty tight call from the umpire and the batsman walks back looking a little bemused. It " +
        "pitched  in line and went on with the arm as he went for a sweep.   Struck low on the front pad and it might just " +

        "skiddy ball and he's out lbw. pretty straight, and just short of a length, and it skids through to beat him and " +
        "trap him in front. Height is the only issue, but the umpire has raised his finger",
        "and this is a lovely bouncer. He has been mis-hit in the past, but this is aimed right at the melon. The batsman " +
        "backs away, and is in no position to pull. Manages a massive edge that settles with mid-off",
        "belts out an lbw appeal and forefinger goes up. The striker departs! This one lifts from a length on off, He plays " +
        "down the wrong line and does not meet with the flick as he is rapped on the knee-roll. It may have just bounced over" +
        " the stumps. Not too sure",
        "superb delivery. This is beautifully bowled! It pitches on a length outside off and jags back in sharply, enough to" +
        " beat the inside edge of the bat and strike him on the back pad. The umpire waits for a bit before raising his " +
        "finger. The batsman was looking to play it to the leg side but did not account for the movement.",
        "This stand has been broken, courtesy some sharp bowling. The captain is pumped. This was floated on middle, the " +
        "batsman goes low for a sweep but misses and is struck on the back pad. The umpire raises his forefinger",
        "This was fuller jags in and on middle, he seeks to flick it across the line but misses his stroke, he is struck " +
        "on the pad, well below the knee roll. The batsman was crease-bound there and pays the penalty That would have " +
        "smacked into middle and leg and given!",
        "and he gets his man now! He is elated and his hands aloft in joy. This one skids off the deck on middle, might " +
        "have been the slippery one. The striker misses the reverse sweep and the umpire raises his forefinger",
        "the bowler has struck when it mattered! This one was angling in from leg stump, the batsman looked to glance it " +
        "off the pads but could not connect and was struck in front of leg. Finger went up in no time even though it wasn't " +
        "really plumb",
        "this ball pins him lbw. This was fullish and on off, The batsman shuffles across off and does not meet with the " +
        "flick, rapped on the front pad. Struck in front of off and he has to depart. He exults",
        "in-ducker does the trick again. This was on a good length and comes in on off, the batsman aims for an across-the-line" +
        " flick and misses, plumb in front. Oh wait, replays reveal that he had gotten an inside-snick on to front pad. " +
        "Unfortunate..",
        "full-toss on middle and leg, and he's lbw. Swivelled to pull and it smacked him flush on the thigh pad. Was on its " +
        "way down when it struck him.",
        "the slower delivery works, he is gone! It was an offcutter coming in from outside off, he moved across to help it " +
        "to leg but could not connect and was trapped in front of middle stump",
        "he has been given out lbw! Fractionally back of a length and swerves in on middle, he seeks to flick it away, but " +
        "is rapped on the front pad on the knee roll. The umpire raises his forefinger",
        "Inward yorker. Boom. This was hurled in on the blockhole, swings in. The batsman is late to bring his bat down in a" +
        " bid to squirt it away. Trapped on the front pad in front of the leg stump. It would have grazed leg. The forefinger" +
        " goes up",
        "Fullish and angled in to beat the batsman's push and strike him on the back pad. This would have crashed into middle" +
        " and leg. It was the slower one and he was hoodwinked. The captain lets out a roar",
        "he appealed for it all alone, and got the umpire to raise his finger. The danger man is gone! This one was much slower" +
        " around the off stump, he got into position early to paddle it fine and took it on the pad for a leg bye. The bowler" +
        " appealed long and hard and the umpire took his time to raise the finger but did it eventually. Simmons took his eyes" +
        " off the ball and got a big inside edge which the umpire didn't spot",
        "given lbw! Fired the ball full and angling into the batsman from round the wicket, he was caught on his crease and " +
        "struck in front as he played across the line. That looked pretty adjacent. The umpire took a while to raise his finger" +
        " and before he did the fielder at slip had collected the ball and broken the stumps at the striker's end. So there " +
        "was an appeal for a run out too, but he was then given lbw. Replays show that the ball might have been clipping leg" +
        " stump, but Marsh would have been given run out had he not been given lbw",
        "he's got him first ball, he started with a flat delivery on the stumps, short of length, the batsman pulled and " +
        "missed it and was struck right in front. Maybe he thought it was too high and wasn't that happy. Looked plumb in " +
        "replays",
        "does him in! Drew him forward with the length and then the pitch offers just enough zip, at just enough pace to beat" +
        " Baz. Defends down the wrong line, struck in front. Oh, but was there an inside edge? The reaction suggests as much...",
        "swinging yorker towards the stumps now, appeal from the bowler for lbw and he's given! The batter tried to paddle " +
        "the ball on the leg side, didn't connect and was hit low and in front of off stump",
        "another wicket, the angle from round the wicket has done it as he gets his man! Stayed on the back foot and covered" +
        " the stumps to steer the ball to leg with the angle, but missed it and was caught in front of middle stump",
        "the bowler strikes, he has to depart. This was the magical one from the bowler, he controls it. The striker's balance is" +
        " shot as he falls over the flick and is smacked on the front pad in front of middle. It would have grazed leg. The " +
        "forefinger goes up",
        "struck in front! This was pushed through on leg stump, pulling him into a sweep, but the ball gains a lot of zip " +
        "from the pitch and hits him in front of middle stump. Seemed a fair decision. Lovely bowling, went wide of the " +
        "crease to create a different angle",
        "and he strikes pre-emptively! This was pitched up and swerves in, the striker hangs on the back foot, does not meet" +
        " with the defensive push, rapped on the back pad in front of middle. The forefinger goes up!",
        "he has been given leg before by the umpire, the batsman is confounded with this dipping full toss and misses as he" +
        " flails desperately at it, but that seemed to be headed down the leg side, replays show that even struck him " +
        "comfortably outside the leg stump, that is an atrocious, atrocious decision",
        "and he has been sent back to the pavilion! He tried to sweep that one as it was pitched up on middle stump, he was" +
        " struck right in front and the finger went up soon after the loud appeal.",
        "appeal for lbw, he has been given out now. This was another in-dipper from the bowler, his nemesis misses it and " +
        "is rapped on the back pad. He did not account for the movement here. This may have pitched outside leg.... Might " +
        "have been snaking down. Tight call. Yes, it pitched just outside leg",
        "the umpire has given him out lbw! This one is plumb. This is a top delivery, pitched just outside off, doesn't do " +
        "as much as an ordinary ball should, beats the sweep and hits him in front of middle. This is straightforward"
