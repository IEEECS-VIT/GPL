    "The batsman had no clue about this ball.. He played back to it and was hit right in front.",
    "This was the one that went in and the batsman looked to work it away on the leg side, got hit right in front of the  middle stump.. Easy decision for the umpire",
    "gone! This is full, fast and hitting middle and leg stump. The batsman is too slow to bring his bat down and is  caught plumb in front. He falls over as he tries to flick it",
    "The lack of pace accounts for him this time!",
    "Pitched on middle and leg, the ball skidded through and went on straight, the batsman was trapped on the back foot  and plumb in front",
    "The lack of pace accounts for him this time!",
    "Absolutely supreme ! The ball pitched just on the off stump line, moving that fraction of  a fraction inwards to  flummox the batsman,   who gets confused and offers no shot, only to find the umpire's raised finger, signalling his doom.",
    "what just happened here ? What would have otherwise been a straightforward delivery on middle stump has been made  to look like a monster ball.   The batsman tries a switch hit, only he manages to mess it up completely. The ball hit him low on the pads, he's a dead man.",
    "The umpire needed no technological assistance for this, it was as plumb as it can possibly be. Pitched on off stump,  didn't bounce as much as the batsman would have liked, and he walks off with his tail between his legs.",
    "That's struck him in front ! The bowler is in ecstasy, doesn't even wait for the umpire's signal.",
    "that's gone, the bowler tries a reverse paddle, misses this big time and is caught in front",
    "This bowler needs only balls to strike, he has the batsman lbw, it was a delayed appeal for lbw, that was a back of  length ball around off stump, the batsman tries to whip that away, pad first,   a bit of doubt over whether that would have hit off, the umpire is convinced though",
    "trapped in the crease and he has to trudge back. No doubt about this one. This came on and struck him on the back  pad as he was looking to clip to midwicket.   The ball skids on and he's a goner",
    "it's given! That's a pretty tight call from the umpire and the batsman walks back looking a little bemused. It pitched  in line and went on with the arm as he went for a sweep.   Struck low on the front pad and it might just have grazed off stump."
