    "keeps coming out, the bowler pushes this straight and on a length outside off, the batsman misses it and is stumped  by miles",
    "The ball moved away from the batsman, beating his booming hoick in to the covers. The keeper does well to collect  the ball behind the stumps,   before ending this partnership. Smart keeping",
    "That is some effort by the opposition ! The keeper was standing up to the stumps, the batsman took the bait and  charged out to an otherwise harmless delivery,   and has lost his wicket in the process. Strange cricket this...",
    "well that was the plan with him to hit the bowler, except that this delivery has gone in nowhere as expected. The batsman hasn't been watching them out of the hand, which turns his advance down the wicket into a highly low-percentage shot. Beaten comprehensively by the googly, and is stumped by a mile",
