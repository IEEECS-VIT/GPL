        "That is some effort by the opposition ! The keeper was standing up to the stumps, the batsman took the bait and " +
        " charged out to an otherwise harmless delivery,   and has lost his wicket in the process. Strange cricket this...",
        "well that was the plan with him to hit the bowler, except that this delivery has gone in nowhere as expected. The " +
        "batsman hasn't been watching them out of the hand, which turns his advance down the wicket into a highly low-percentage" +
        " shot. Beaten comprehensively by the googly, and is stumped by a mile",
        "he wanted another one but is beaten by the change in pace and is stumped so fast by the keeper before the striker " +
        "can even look back. Came down the track for the ball that was outside off, it was much flatter and went under the " +
        "horizontal bat as he missed it. Our keeper does the best",
        "another stumping chance, this one goes to the third umpire no idea why! He came well out of his crease, got beaten " +

        "The batsman is down the track, the bowler pulls his length back a bit and fires it outside off. He can't connect " +
        "with, the keeper can't connect with it properly either. The ball brushes his gloves, pops out and disturbs the " +
        "woodwork. The batsman is short, he is stumped.",
        "The bowler and keeper pose a question. Is the batsman out stumped? He is in trouble and has to go. Sharp work from " +
        "the keeper. The umpires check for a possible no-ball, its a legal ball. He started walking even before OUT flashed " +
        "on the big screen. Dragged himself forward and does not meet with the sweep. This quicker ball beats him, sneaks " +
        "through and DK whips the bails off in super quick time to catch the striker short. His back foot was not grounded " +
        "when it mattered",
        "what was he doing? It was a length ball on leg stump, and the batsman didn't connect with the sweep. Wandered out " +
        "of his crease as it rolled to the keeper, and before he could realise it the bails were off - he took so long " +
        "realising it that the keeper missed the stumps once and took the bails off the second time",
        "gone! The bowler saw the striker stepping down the pitch and fired in an arm ball that slid between bat and pad, " +
        "and the keeper did brilliantly there, in such an understated way, to collect calmly outside leg stump and whip off " +
        "the bails",
        "strikes, and he roars! Much slower through the air, looped up outside off, lures the batsman out of the crease. The" +

        "in a flash",
        "he perishes and this is a crucial strike for the bowling side.. This was flatter and moving away outside off, so he" +
        " rocks back and slices it high in the air. The fielder juggles and pouches it at deep cover",
        "He gives this ample air outside off and gets it to move away. The batsman is lured out of the crease, swipes across" +
        " the line and misses. The keeper whips the bails off in a flash",
        "stumping now! The batsman gives the charge, the bowler reacts in time and lobs this up outside off. THe batsman is " +
        "beaten in flight, can't loft it over the covers. Keeper does the rest",
        "stumped! He came down the track, the bowler made it flatter outside off, the batsman pushes and missed it. The " +
        "wicketkeeper does the rest",
        "done it! He walked down, tried to steer it with the angle to the leg side, but the ball went the other way from around" +
        " off and beat him completely. The keeper does the rest",
        "runs past a straight one! He was looking for extra cover having signalled his move way too early. The bowler drags " +
        "his length back, refuses to give him the angle he wants and just smiles as he pulls off an easy stumping",
        "and that befuddles the batsman! He chips down the track, the bowler pushes a slider outside off. He can't connect " +
        "with the cut, the keeper whips the bails off",
        "gone now, misses the ball and he's stumped! He came down the track to loft the ball with the turn, the ball came in" +
        " to beat his bat and the keeper whipped the bails off quickly",
        "gone this time, beaten by the trajectory! He came down the track to slam it again, but the length delivery turned " +
        "away from him as he swung his bat and  he did the rest before the batsman could look back",
        "squares him up! The stand has been broken. He loops this up outside off and lures the batsman out of the crease. " +
        "This does away a touch as well. He is beaten in line, the keeper makes no mistake now. Whips the bails off in a " +
        "flash",
        "gone. Saw him coming down the track and slid it flat and wide outside off. Quick work from the keeper as well, " +
        "collects and has the bails off before the striker can even try and turn and try to regain his crease",
        "gone! That's another lovely bit of skill from the bowler. Sees the batsman skip down the track and defeats him with" +
        " his trajectory again. The ball dips and goes sharply down the leg side and the man behind the stump does the rest",
        "he has another wicket. Lovely stumping from the keeper. The bowler sees him coming from a mile away, slips in a " +
        "quick wide ball that lands just short of the popping crease, but the keeper makes a superb collection and whips " +
        "the bail off. The batsman is down on ground, and so are his team mates in the dugout"
