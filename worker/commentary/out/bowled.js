    "What's happening! You don't expect such loose shots from the batsman. Another tame delivery just outside off and he" +
    " has a lazy waft at that one, ends up chopping it on to his stumps",
    "he's tried to force a length ball over mid-on, but mishit it, and the fielder has plenty of time to take the dolly",
    "superb delivery hits top of off, good length, pitches around middle, the batsman looks to defend from the crease, " +
    "the ball seams away past the outside edge to hit the stumps",
    "this one beats the inside edge of the bat, flicks the front pad and then takes the off bail ..",
    "off stump is pegged back and the bowler is on a roll! It was flat, it skidded off the deck and it sneaked below the" +
    " intended cut",
    "angled in, the batsman swings and misses, and we hear the sound of leather on timber.",
    "gone on the slog sweep, swift delivery, full around leg, he gets down for the slog sweep, misses and is bowled",
    "gone through him, angled in, pitched up, not really the length to be playing back to, but the batsman prefers that," +
    " this time he is caught in an awkward position as this rushes in and goes through to hit the stumps",
    "angles this full into the stumps, the batsman has a swing and miss, and the ball hits middle",
    "was bowling round the wicket, the batsman made a lot of room early on looking to push it to the off side, he may " +
    "have expected turn but it went straight through and knocked the middle stump",
    "skidded through and hit the stumps, the batsman was rooted to the crease, left a big gap",
    "right through him. The bowler nips this in a mile from just outside off, on a good length, he has moved across and " +
    "set himself up for a forcing stroke, and there is no way he can account for so much movement, through the gate and " +
    "into the stumps",
    "got him this time, slows it down a bit, gives it some air, the line is around off, the batsman is confused " +
    "immediately, pushes weakly for some movement, there isn't any, and the stumps are rattled",
    "what a yorker! The batsman was so late on it and he throws a little look back at the stumps. That slingy action " +
    "brought the ball back in at him and his jittery stay in the middle ends in the most emphatic fashion",
    "that stumps are in disarray again! Another fuller ball finds its mark. He was making room to try and open up the " +
    "off side which made it all the more complicated for him to intervene with the ball's trajectory and off stump is " +
    "knocked back",
    "castled! Skids on after pitching and sneaks through his bat and pad. The batsman's feet fail him once again as this" +
    " one is pitched on a good length and deviates in at him. He looked all at sea trying to keep that out and by the " +
    "time he played his shot the middle stump was knocked back",

    "leg stump cartwheels! It was length and he was looking to slog it across the line seeking the stands at midwicket. " +
    "Missed it by several inches as the ball sneaks between the bat and pad. The bowler exults!",
    "what a yorker! Leg stump has been uprooted. There was no room to manoeuvre it, which was what he was trying to do " +
    "with a bit of an open face but the ball just kept coming in at him and cramping him up. He also seemed a little " +
    "surprised by the extra pace on that and walks off the field",
    "he telegraphs the slower ball with a change of action. The batsman slogs across the line of this delivery, and has" +
    " his leg stump pegged back.",
    "and he has been bowled. The batsman was pegged back first, then made to play defensive shots. And that's it. That " +
    "is enough in T20 to create pressure that can make you play a low-percentage shot. And he just slogs already. The " +
    "head falls away, is beaten, and the leg stump is pegged back",
    "He has been running balls down to third man well, but his partner has kept getting closer and closer to off. This " +
    "time, he gets the inside edge onto the stumps. Huge wicket",
    "The batsman makes up his mind to slog-sweep, the bowler fires one in full and fast, and it squeezes under the bat " +
    "to knock the stumps back. The batsman has again done the job for his captain.",
    "Good riposte from the bowler and he lets out a roar. This was the arm-ball, quicker and flatter. The batsman aims " +
    "to swipe over midwicket again. He misses it this time. But he nails the middle stump. It is knocked back",
    "strikes back, just as he was threatening to soar, his wings have been clipped. He shuffles across off now, the " +
    "bowler delivers a near-yorker, not pin-point, but it rattles the leg stump. The bowler throws a Johnson-like stare " +
    "at the vanquished striker",
    "mighty full and just outside leg as Mitch swings and misses",
    "knocks the stumps, and he misses it completely! It pitched well outside off and the batsman went back in the " +
    "crease to cut it late but he got too far away from it",
    "why, why would he do that?Tries to reverse sweep the ball that pitches on middle stump. The ball is angling in and " +
    "he's playing the off-stump line, loses his leg stump",
    "He is pretty handy with these slippery back-of-the-hand slower ones. This consumes the batsman. He aims to swipe it" +
    " away to the leg side. He does not lay bat onto it, the ball hits the stumps. Deflected off the pads and onto the " +
    "stumps",
    "the yorker from hell, defeats him. He breaks into a jig - nice moves, man. Fired in, the batsman can't dig it out, " +
    "it slides under his bat to cannon into middle. It gets knocked back.",
    "Completes a brilliant catch and the captain applauds, Slower length ball on middle, the striker steps away a touch " +
    "and slices it in the air. The fielder runs to his right from long-off dives, tumbles and plucks it. The bowler has " +
    "his hands aloft in joy",
    "he has his man! He leaps off his feet and celebrates. This was on a length and on off, hint of inward movement. The" +
    " unsuspecting batsman goes for a low-percentage slog across the line and misses. The impact pegs the off stump back",
    "it's a wicket! Charged down, the length ball coming in sharply from outside off as he looked to slog and missed it " +
    "completely. Ball clips the leg stump",
    "He's running all the way to Antarctica while celebrating! Didn't pick that one as it pitched on length, came in and" +
    " struck the leg stump as the batsman swept",
    "This was on a back of a length, the batsman backs away, has some leverage to thrash through the off side, but makes" +
    " no contact. The ball hits the top of the off-stump",
    "and the yorker consumes him! Right in the blockhole at the base of off, he wants to swing it away from GDN to SJT. " +
    "But only meets with a whole lot of thin air. The off-stump is rattled.",
    "nails the yorker, the middle stump is pegged back. Right in the blockhole, te batsman having backed away, can't " +
    "squeeze it out. The striker misses, the bowler hits now",
    "Right in the blockhole on middle. He can't dig it out",
    "and the bowler strikes, uproots leg and middle stumps, the striker walked across his stumps sensing that the bowler" +
    " would bowl full and into the pads, he did, and the batsman missed, the replays are tight for the front-foot no-ball" +
    " check, but it seems to be just fine",
    "got him, good stuff from th bowler, the batsman has yorked himself, it was tossed up again, the batsman stepped " +
    "out without much conviction, and the ball dipped and slid quickly under his bat to take out middle stump",
    "middle stump is pegged back as he misses a swipe, the fullish ball brushes the thigh pad and crashes into the stump",
    "and he knocks over the timber and roars, the partnership has been broken. This was hurled in flat, hurries onto the " +
    "batsman. He goes low for a slog-sweep and is beaten on the bottom edge, it hits the off stump. Replays actually " +
    "reveal that it was a seam-up delivery",
    "This was darted quick on middle, not too short. The batsman aims for a meaty pull and only meets with thin air. " +
    "This offering thuds into the middle stump",
    "This is a soft, soft dismissal. Full toss outside leg as the batsman steps away. Instead of mowing it away, " +
    "he misses. The ball brushes the front pad and disturbs the stumps. The off-bail is tipped off",
    "that's a top ball from the bowler, he lets out a big roar. This tossed up ball pitches outside leg and wafts past " +
    "the bat and hits the middle stump. The batsman is crease-bound as he looks to flick and misses.",
    "and he takes out the danger man, the latter throws his head back in disappointment. This was on a back of a length" +
    " and on off, the batsman backs away and wants to slog it over the leg side. He can only drag it back onto the off " +
    "stump off a bottom edge",
    "how do you bowl that, and how do you play that? Yorked on middle stump! pretty straightforward that one - straight " +
    "on middle stump, as accurate as it could be on middle stump, and the bat came down late to block it",
    "leg and middle stumps are in disarray as he removes his nemesis! He was looking to be a little too cute with a lap" +
    " sweep, all he did was direct the ball onto his stumps",
    "Mitch pegs the middle stump back, bags the wicket. Fuller length and fired though by the bowler, the striker has " +
    "a huge slog and misses. The bowler hits the stumps. Timber, but all too late.",
    "off stump takes a hit! Was expecting movement, possibly trying to slide it down to third man for a single, but there" +
    " is nothing on the ball. He simply slides it on with the arm and exploits the gap between bat and pad when the " +
    "batsmen expect the ball to deviate away. Hands raised in a simple smile after the fact",
    "knocked him over now! Moves too far across to make use of the gap at long leg, but he can't make contact with the " +
    "length ball on leg stump. He misses, the bowler hits",
    "away goes the off stump. The batsman was making room, and went overboard with it. He fires in the quicker one and " +
    "roars in delight as he beats the batsman all ends up. A little check on the no-ball and all's fine",
    "the slower ball does it, he is gone, the stadium erupts! THe bowler bowled a slower one by his standards, on middle" +
    " and off, the batsman defended on the off side but played the wrong line and got an inside edge onto the stumps",
    "bowled him! Makes room for the shortish delivery to cut off the back foot, misses it completely and loses middle " +
    "stump. THe bowler waves him goodbye",
    "he's bowled this time! He charged down the track, the bowler delivered this one in towards off and middle from " +
    "outside off. THe striker missed as he slogged and the ball did the rest",
    "Came round the wicket and angled this one in, looked like he played for the straighter one but it came in and " +
    "disturbed the stumps",
    "he has knocked him over with a length delivery! He was looking to hoick it over to the cow-corner boundary but " +
    "drags it on to his stumps. Have they got the danger man out? The opposition is in a spot of bother",
    "here's a wicket against the run of play! The bowler fires in a yorker that squeezes under the bat and knocks the " +
    "stumps down. Well done lad!",
    "bowled him! That was pitched outside leg stump. He went for the sweep, the ball may have bounced more than he " +
    "expected, and it hit the top of his pad, and maybe his glove as well, and ricocheted onto leg stump. Looked like " +
    "pad onto forearm.",
    "bowled him. Was going for the slog-sweep, may have been playing for the angle. Went through straight and crashed " +
    "into off stump",
    "short ball outside off, and he's out after a hint of promise. Plays a shovel-pull, doesn't hit it as sweetly as " +
    "he'd like, and pops a simple catch to short midwicket",
    "chops it on. Gives himself room to cut, it does just enough and doesn't bounce as much as expected, and he ends up " +
    "inside-edging into his off stump",
    "bowled him, or is that bowled himself? Stretched across the stumps a long way to play the lap sweep to the full " +
    "ball on leg stump, didn't make any contact",
    "bowled him! That was full and straight, and he was trying to be too cute there. Walked across his stumps, looked " +
    "for the scoop over short fine leg, and it was far too full for that shot",
    "bowled, off stump goes for a wander, made room to carve through the off side, and the bowler simply slipped a " +
    "fast yorker under his bat",
    "and he responds with a yorker that uproots off stump, the batsman was making room again but could not get the bat " +
    "down in time, they check for the no-ball, it is a really tight one, probably had a few millimetres behind the line",
    "This one slides under the bat and hits the stumps. To be fair to the batsman, this was the work of the pitch. It " +
    "stayed very low after bouncing on a length. But hr will take it. His wickets tally keeps going up",
    "continues to deal in full tosses, but he sends him back with this one, it straightens late on the line, he wants to" +
    " hoick it, only inside-edges into the stumps",
    "rams into the off stump at furious pace! Angled it in from outside off, he made room and swung his arms but the " +
    "ball rammed into the off stump",
    "bowled'em or bowled himself? The leg stump goes for a wander. Yorker speared in, the batsman had premeditated a " +
    "lap-scoop after shuffling miles across off. He failed to AB de Villiers it away, the ball batters the leg stump. " +
    "The captain shakes his head in the dug-out",
    "wild slog for the straight delivery and that's gone through! The length delivery pitched on middle stump and " +
    "turned away a bit as he looked to slog it to the leg side and missed it by miles",
    "another slog against the away-going delivery, another wicket! Looked like a pre-meditated shot as he went down on " +
    "a knee and slog-swept the ball against the turn and missed the line completely. Off and middle stumps are rattled",
    "sheer pace and accuracy, he smiles as the off stump goes for a walk! the striker made some room and the ball landed" +
    " on length and rocketed onto the stumps to send it flying",
    "the middle-stump takes a beating! Poor shot selection as he goes for a cross-batted hoick off a length delivery and" +
    " loses the stumps. A big shame as he was looking like he was ready for the final thrust. The bowler doesn't react " +
    "much",
    "superb bowling! The batsman ran out of options - he had to hit out, but this is a beautifully disguised slower " +
    "delivery, lands on a length and keeps coming in. Swings his bat at that but misses and the ball flattens the leg " +
    "stump",
    "and he gets another one! Charges down the pitch, gets a slower delivery that beats the bat and grazes the top of " +
    "middle stump. This bowler is looking to run through the lineup now",
    "He bangs it short, the batsman is tucked up for room and does not get hold of the attempted pull. The ball grazes " +
    "the front thigh, elbow and then disturbs the leg stump",
    "nails the yorker and rattles the off stump! This was just too good. Yorker comes in with the angle and tails away " +
    "late from round the stumps, brings his bat down late and fails to keep it out",
    "and this one makes light work of the batsman. He fires in one of those pin-point yorkers that move away, the batsman" +
    " can't squeeze it out after backing away. Crashes into the off stump and the bowler exults",
    "deflects onto the stumps, he is gone! The bowler angled it into the pads, he looked to heave that to the leg side " +
    "and it deflects off the pads to the off stump",
    "gone now, the bowler shortened the length considerably this time, and he ended up chopping it into the stumps as he" +
    " tried running it to third man",
    "bowled with a straighter and slower delivery, the crowd is wide awake! The dibbly-dobbly kept a bit low as he looked" +
    " to turn it to leg, missed it completely and lost his off and middle",
    "even better yorker, that's unplayable! The batsman stayed back in the crease, tried to block it back, but it swung " +
    "late and uprooted two stumps out of three. What a treat to watch, that ball!",
    "he's bowled him! A quicker ball outside off stump, a bit on the shorter side but the attempt at cutting it ended up" +
    " in a bottom edge on to his stumps. That was really quick from the bowler",
    "and he's bowled! He went back in the crease an exposed his stumps, wanted to cut the ball from off stump but it " +
    "hurried on to him and knocked the off stump over",
    "It came in sharply from outside off, he went in the crease to steer the ball to the leg side and the ball stayed " +
    "low to find the gap between bat and pad. The crowd is loving this!",
    "the slower one finally does it, he misses it completely! It was the slower offcutter from just outside off, played " +
    "early and let one hand go off the bat when he realised he didn't pick it, and the ball knocked over the off stump",
    "that's the quicker one from him and he knocks the off stump! The flatter delivery came in from just outside off, he" +
    " tried to cut it off the back foot but was beaten by the pace and his bat came down late",
    "he deserves that! Slid in the quicker, flatter delivery as he saw him running at him. No room to work the ball. All" +
    " he can do is try and stop it from passing him. But since he wanted to belt the ball, he's in two minds. Uncertain " +
    "prod does him in",
    "slower ball does the trick and the bowler is off on a jig. It's a bit short so the striker loaded up on the pull, " +
    "but he is a bit overeager. Manages an inside edge that disturbs the stumps",
    "full and straight, he misses, you hit. He's made up for a lot of undoing in the recent past",
    "block hole it is on the stumps, he's fallen over and the stumps have been rattled! He shuffled across well outside " +
    "off and tried to paddle the ball fine but got an inside edge and the ball got the base of middle stump",
    "the movement has done it, inside edge onto the stumps! He went down on a knee for the fullish delivery outside off, " +
    "drove away from the body but the ball swung in and hit the leg stump after the inside edge",
    "another inside edge, another wicket! He angled the ball across Marsh outside off, he played the wrong line, trying " +
    "to nudge the ball towards third man but got an inside edge and that uprooted the leg stump!",
    "the sound of the ball crashing into the stumps, followed by silence in the ground! He makes room to smash the ball," +
    " it's right in the block hole at good pace and it rattles the stumps",
    "inside edge onto the stumps, first ball! The ball was well outside off, he pushed at it away from the body without " +
    "any footwork and edged it on to off and middle stumps",
    "what a riposte from the bowler, the stadium raises itself to a roar. This was fuller and jags away, the batsman seeks" +
    " to clip it away to the leg side but does not read the movement. the ball rattles the top of off stump",
    "the off stump goes for a toss. This was fuller and curls in from outside off, he is crease-bound as he attempts a " +
    "feeble drive. Too quick for him. He does not get hold of it and the off stump takes a beating",
    "does him in on the second try! Goes for the reverse swat again, but this time he's pulled his length back and slanted" +
    " it outside leg stump. The edge goes against the batsman, for once",
    "struck! What a ball, he beats the bat completely by targeting the stumps this time, it didn't really do much as it " +
    "pitched on middle and off to go straight, but the batsman was never in control of this one as he looked to steer this" +
    " to leg, Off stump uprooted!",
    "inside edge onto the stumps, he's gone! It was a slower one outside off, he went back and across in the crease to " +
    "swipe it on the leg side but only edged it onto his off stump",
    "the yorker can't stay away from this bowler for too long! Full, swinging in on the middle stump, the striker makes " +
    "room to target the off side but the ball rams into the stumps",
    "his struggle is over, he's failed to connect for the final time this innings, charges out to a full toss, heaves and" +
    " misses, the line is right on the stumps, and the off peg is uprooted",
    "played on! Undone by the other one and the stadium has been hushed into silence. This one moves in from outside off" +
    " with extra bounce, the batsman backs away and seeks to cut it through the covers, perhaps. But drags it back onto " +
    "the stumps",
    "The experiment fails! Back of a length, he wants to swipe it away, but can only drag it back on to the off stump " +
    "via a thick inside edge",
    "what a corker! This is full and swings away very late. He wanted to whip it through the leg side but this moves away" +
    " from the blade and takes out the middle stump. That is a one helluva delivery",
    "off stump knocked over! he has not looked like his usual self and he falls to an average slog! It was a good length" +
    " ball angled across. The batsman went across the line with the scoreboard pressure bearing down on him. Misses and " +
    "the bowler hits.",
    "top of off knocked back again! He runs down and misses a length, slightly slower, ball as he plays outside the line." +
    " Bat and pad gap exploited and the crowd continues to rumble",
    "lazy drive on the up outside off, the bowler jags the ball back and hurtles through bat and pad to peg off stump. " +
    "This has become a procession",
    "buh-bye, and he just smiles after messing up the off stump. It was fast, it was straight, it got the slog from the " +
    "batsman, it beat him and he makes a forlorn walk back to the pavilion",
    "The stumps are in tatters! He walks back with a duck. Swung at a length ball which was just too quick for him",
    "that's the seventh batsman out bowled! Full, fast, threatening off stump and these aren't idle threats either. Too " +
    "good.",
    "kisses the base of middle and off stump! A second straight yorker and this time he gets it through his defences. " +
    "Top quality bowling from the bowler",
    "clatters into the base of middle stump! The batsman was moving outside leg to smear it through the covers but it " +
    "sneaks under his bat",
    "moves too early, backing away towards leg to slog, he sees him going and fires the ball flat, fast and straight, " +
    "cramping the batsman for room. Swings across the line and misses. Bowled.",
    "reverse-swatting is not as easy as one might think! The length is too full and the line too straight for the shot. " +
    "The batsman misses and the ball rattles off stump",
    "He went deep into his crease to try and cut the ball, the length was a bit full and the line was too straight. He " +
    "missed and the bowler hit.",
    "bowled him! He adjusts his line outside off stump, and the length isn't a full toss, it is good. He tries to drag " +
    "it from outside off towards leg and gets an inside edge on to the stumps.",
    "slowed it up so nicely! He was into the flick way too early, and then the ball finally floats over to him, dribbles" +
    " off the inside edge and onto the stumps. Lovely delivery against a man looking to constantly play leg side. Make " +
    "your own pace, says the bowler, and comes off better for it",
    "plays on! And he off on a run! It's a flat, quick delivery. He was moving back and making room to cut. But the angle" +
    " foils his efforts. Ends up chopping onto off stump",
    "that's the last time the pull shot will fail him tonight. It's his normal pace, and it's short without offering too" +
    " much room. he swivels on the back foot for the stroke, but he's still a bit late on the shot. Inside edge crashes " +
    "into timber",
    "The delivery takes everybody by surprise by hitting leg stump! The batsman moved a long way across his stumps and " +
    "got down on one knee to sweep, he exposed his leg stump that was the end of his innings",
    "He gets down on one knee to slog across the line but the length is quick and the pace is faster, it sneaks under his" +
    " bat and bowls him",
    "bowled him! He moved a long way across his stumps, exposing all three, to try and paddle the ball towards short fine" +
    " leg, the length was too full and it beat the bat and hit the stumps",
    "is that out? The bails are off..is he bowled or was it the keeper's gloves that took them off? There was no room as" +
    " the ball came in from just outside off, he went back to cut it and was beaten past the outside edge. Replays clearly" +
    " show the ball dislodged the bails, big wicket this one"
