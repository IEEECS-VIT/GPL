    "He tries to punch this short of length delivery through cover, there is no room, and he ends up chopping this on to  the stumps..",
    "What's happening! You don't expect such loose shots from the batsman. Another tame delivery just outside off and he   has a lazy waft at that one, ends up chopping it on to his stumps",
    "he's tried to force a length ball over mid-on, but mishit it, and the fielder has plenty of time to take the dolly",
    "superb delivery hits top of off, good length, pitches around middle, the batsman looks to defend from the crease,   the ball seams away past the outside edge to hit the stumps",
    "this one beats the inside edge of the bat, flicks the front pad and then takes the off bail ..",
    "off stump is pegged back and the bowler is on a roll! It was flat, it skidded off the deck and it sneaked below the  intended cut",
    "angled in, the batsman swings and misses, and we hear the sound of leather on timber.",
    "gone on the slog sweep, swift delivery, full around leg, he gets down for the slog sweep, misses and is bowled",
    "gone through him, angled in, pitched up, not really the length to be playing back to, but the batsman prefers that,   this time he is caught in an awkward position as this rushes in and goes through to hit the stumps",
    "angles this full into the stumps, the batsman has a swing and miss, and the ball hits middle",
    "was bowling round the wicket, the batsman made a lot of room early on looking to push it to the off side, he may have   expected turn but it went straight through and knocked the middle stump",
    "skidded through and hit the stumps, the batsman was rooted to the crease, left a big gap",
    "right through him. The bowler nips this in a mile from just outside off, on a good length, he has moved across and set   himself up for a forcing stroke, and there is no way he can account for so much movement, through the gate and into the stumps",
    "got him this time, slows it down a bit, gives it some air, the line is around off, the batsman is confused immediately,   pushes weakly for some movement, there isn't any, and the stumps are rattled",
    "what a yorker! The batsman was so late on it and he throws a little look back at the stumps. That slingy action brought   the ball back in at him and his jittery stay in the middle ends in the most emphatic fashion",
    "that stumps are in disarray again! Another fuller ball finds its mark. He was making room to try and open up the   off side which made it all the more complicated for him to intervene with the ball's trajectory and off stump is knocked back",
    "castled! Skids on after pitching and sneaks through his bat and pad. The batsman's feet fail him once again as this   one is pitched on a good length and deviates in at him. He looked all at sea trying to keep that out and by the time he played his shot the middle stump was knocked back",
    "off stump is knocked back !. The slog over midwicket fails again and this time it signals the end of his innings",
    "leg stump cartwheels! It was length and he was looking to slog it across the line seeking the stands at midwicket.   Missed it by several inches as the ball sneaks between the bat and pad. The bowler exults!",
    "what a yorker! Leg stump has been uprooted. There was no room to manoeuvre it, which was what he was trying to do   with a bit of an open face but the ball just kept coming in at him and cramping him up. He also seemed a little surprised by the extra pace on that and walks off the field",
    "he telegraphs the slower ball with a change of action. The batsman slogs across the line of this delivery,   and has his leg stump pegged back.",
    "and he has been bowled. The batsman was pegged back first, then made to play defensive shots. And that's it. That is enough in T20 to create pressure that can make you play a low-percentage shot. And he just slogs already. The head falls away, is beaten, and the leg stump is pegged back",
    "He has been running balls down to third man well, but his partner has kept getting closer and closer to off. This time, he gets the inside edge onto the stumps. Huge wicket",
    "The batsman makes up his mind to slog-sweep, the bowler fires one in full and fast, and it squeezes under the bat to knock the stumps back. The batsman has again done the job for his captain.",
