        "poor ball from the bowler.. this is a full toss and a high one.. the batsman smashes it over midwicket with ease",
        "he looks to make room, but that's a bluff.. The bowler fires it on his pads and all the batsman has to do is " +
        "to get  some bat on it.. he flicks it to deep backward square leg boundary",

        "leg side  and is surprised as this thick outside edge flies quickly past him",

        "flicks him  over square leg and that races quickly...",
        "manages to get his swing down in time.. not the best of timing behind that, but it clears mid-on",

        "not only  manages to create room, but also times it perfectly behind point to pick up a boundary",
        "that was not too far from the mid-on fielder! The batsman punches this through the line and in the air and " +

        "mid-on",

        " shuffles  across and swings. Gets lucky",
        "short ball and he pounces on it. Let one go earlier in the over but this time he puts a lot more muscle into" +
        " the  shot. And found the gap between long-on and midwicket",
        "there's some aggression. Lashes it inside out over the cover field. Made room and opened up his stance to " +
        "place it  in the gap",
        "he glances it to the left of short fine leg and it has enough to skim off to the boundary. The bowler is " +
        "angry with  his poor line",
        "this time he goes aerial. It was fullish on off stump, but he stayed put to make sure his arms had enough " +
        "room to  swing clean through the line. The advertising boards at long-off takes a battering.",
        "low full toss on off stump, the batsman plants his front leg down the pitch and drills it to the long-off " +
        "boundary.  There was no stopping that",
        "Late cuts a back of a length ball from off stump and beats short third man",
        "no trouble despite the lack of room. It has to be on middle to keep him quiet and this was down leg stump " +
        "and the  batsman has pulverized it to the long leg boundary",
        "no trouble timing that one. Again when there is width on offer, he looks imperious. Sinks down to reach the" +
        " almost  wide yorker and squeezes it through point",
        "that was clean! Invited the batsman on the front foot and was also offering enough room for him to exploit. " +
        "A simple  extension of the arms sends it scurrying through the cover field",
        "slower one outside off, he moves outside leg and smashes it past extra cover's dive",
        "over midwicket, attacks a length delivery from outside off and crashes it one bounce over the rope",
        "succeeds this time, another one gets up, not as much as the previous one, but the batsman is ready and cuts" +
        " it high  over point",
        "gets some width and slaps the length delivery in the air and wide of extra cover",
        "down the pads this time and he sends it wide of short fine leg",
        "this was fuller, going across, providing him some room to lean forward and stroke it between extra cover " +
        "and mid  off",
        "starts with a very high full toss, the batsman swings hard, gets a top edge that flies over short third " +
        "man, not  called a no-ball for height, the bowler was lucky there",
        "the batsman jabs bat down on it, third man is square and has little chance with this",
        "tries a full and wide one, the batsman reaches for it and coolly lifts it into the straight boundary",
        "incredible hitting this, reverse sweep now, bowled full and quick into the legs, but the batsman is quick " +
        "enough to  set himself up to force it high over point",
        "he skips out, and lifts it over midwicket, right in the gap, long on has no chance",
        "full down the pad with fine leg up, the batsman swings it hard and almost gets six",
        "that will go in the gap between point and short third man, a wide yorker, the batsman squeezes it out and " +
        "splits  the gap",
        "a chance, the fielder in fact pulled out here at long as the batsman lofted this to his left, was possibly " +
        "blinded  by the lights",
        "the batsman lunges on a knee and sweeps it very cleanly over the man",
        "fine leg is up, the bowler sends in a full rocket on the pads, the batsman gives it direction over the " +
        "fielder with  a stylish, wristy flick",
        "a slower ball gets the batsman going, he has smacked it over midwicket",
        "pitches this up around off, and the batsman slams it with disdain over mid off",
        "straightening down the leg side and the batsman has all the time in the world to pull hard through square " +
        "leg this  time",
        "tossed up on middle and leg and he slogs him over midwicket",
        "nicely played, the keeper was up, a hint of width, no slip and he gently steered this down to third man",
        "that was a gift, friendly full toss on the pads, all he had to do was shuffle slightly and work it wide of " +
        "the keeper",
        "crashed that past the gap! This was on a good length wide outside off, slapped that wide if backward point",
        "lovely use of the wrists! This was a half volley on the stumps, shuffles across the stumps, works the wrists" +
        " and  places it wide of midwicket",
        "drops it short, the batsman lifts that on the up, good contact to launch that over cover, a couple of bounces" +
        " before  reaching the boundary",
        " makes room and caves a full ball over point to finish the innings with a boundary",
        "falls inches short of the rope, this was too short and wide outside off, the batsman hops and upper cuts it" +
        " down to  third man, a little more power and it would have gone all the way",
        "That was smashed with such force and the bowler did well to get his head out of the way, full ball and the" +
        " batsman  made room and smashed that down the ground",
        "this time he fires it full on the stumps, the batsman drives firmly wide of extra cover, the field was up",
        "too good for the boundary rider! This was too full and wide outside off, the batsman shuffled a long way to" +
        " meet the  ball, placed wide of cover and the sweeper couldn't stop it",
        "strays down leg, fine leg leg was up, he sweeps fine and it's an easy boundary",
        "picks the vacant area, this was drifting on the pads, the batsman shuffled across early and neatly chipped" +
        " it over  short fine leg",
        "this was dropped fractionally short, he read the length early and pulled him flat over square leg, one bounce" +
        " and  over",
        "this was pitched up wide outside off, in the hitting zone, lofts through the line and clears cover, long-on" +
        " cannot  cut it off",
        "invites the batsman to use his feet, comes down the pitch and lofts him over mid-off",
        "sped away quickly, this was too full and wide outside off, the batsman gets across and smashes it along the" +
        " turf  wide of cover",
        "this was the right length for the batsman to pull, length ball a touch wide outside off, he fetches that and" +
        " pulls  along the ground wide of midwicket",
        "out of nowhere, he has connected with a scoop, he goes outside off, bends the knee and turns this length ball" +
        " to the  fine leg rope",
        "swings at a full delivery, and a thick inside edge runs fine down the leg side",
        "opens the face and drives through the covers for four more, he is toying with the field",
        "there is no width here, full and on middle stump, but the batsman has opened the face and timed it in the gap" +
        " past  extra cover",
        "third man is up, this is short and wide, and he hops to cut it miles over the man",
        "this time he goes way in front of square, dragging the full delivery over the infield, no chance for the sweeper",
        "reverse sweep that clears point very comfortably",
        "he sets himself up for the reverse sweep even as the bowler is about to release the ball, and connects the " +
        "low full  toss to beat short third man",
        "he goes over mid on, goes back and to the leg side, and swings it over the infield",
        "played with lots of aggression, width outside off, and he cuts hard behind point",
        "the bowler staying wide outside off and the batsman going off this time, a full toss is lifted easily over " +
        "extra  cover",
        "a wide yorker now, but in vain, third man is up and he squeezes it wide of the fielder",
        "a full toss outside off is smashed back down the ground, and beats long on and long off",
        "full into the pad, he shuffles a bit, and manages to run it fine",
        "he uses his reach, reaches the pitch of this one outside off and swats it straight down the ground",
        "picks the gap at deep midwicket, this is full and angled in, and he clears front leg to swing it away",
        " lofts this pitched up ball over extra cover now, stretches forward and powers it away",
        "he carts this full delivery to long who drops it, and it runs behind him into the boundary",
        "tries to mow his big slog sweep, manages only an inside edge that somehow eludes his stumps and trickles " +
        "away to the  ropes",
        "he goes back, has some width this time, and cuts hard to the third man rope with the man up in the ring",
        "makes good use of the poor delivery, goes back in the crease and slogs hard over midwicket",
        "hammered down the ground, the umpire stretches his right hand to signal no-ball and at the same time, also " +
        "gets out  of the way as the batsman cracks this pitched up ball straight back",
        "some hitting from the batsman, this is not short at all, but he's picked it up so cleanly, it flies to the " +
        "deep  midwicket rope",
        "he's leaned into this drive, timed it on the up, and placed it past short extra cover's dive",
        "he swivels to pull it in the air to the deep backward square leg boundary",
        "steps out, stretches a bit, and lifts it flat over extra cover",
        "outside edge, there is no slip, and these are four fortunate runs, came forward to defend, but this was the " +
        "one that  went the other way",
        "that is would have pierced the bowler right in half, it's hit hard down to him at long off, couple of bounces," +
        " the  bowler bends and cups his wrists to stop the ball, but it goes through",
        "what a shot, he's walked out, and his momentum has given this lofted push so much distance, it's almost gone " +
        "over  the deep extra cover rope, it is in the gap anyway",
        "scooped fine over the keeper, the batsman comes across, bends and gets enough bat on this length ball",
        "length ball angled in to the pad, and the batsmans tucks it very fine",
        "now the cut, width provided, and the batsman capitalises with a sharp cut",
        "the slog sweep, an almighty top edge of a slog sweep, no one at deep square leg, and it plonks down near the " +
        "rope  and rolls into it",
        "that is as clean a hit as any, the batsman has made some room outside leg stump, and blitzed this length " +
        "delivery  over mid off with a straight, high follow thorugh",
        "too short, too wide, he intentionally flays it in the air and comfortably clears cover",
        "connects well, slightly fuller, the batsman comes forward and lifts it over covers",
        "length in to the pad now, and the batsman steps down the track and turn it neatly through midwicket",
        "shot, gets on his toes and punches this back of a length ball in the air just past point",
        "madness out there, he turns it to midwicket, he wants the single for about a few steps, then he doesn't, " +
        "his partner  wants it some more, then he hesitates, decides to go for it, he has no choice, the captain " +
        "has made it for him, the throw is way off target at the keeper's end, the man backing up follows up with a " +
        "worse one at the bowler's end, and it runs all the way to the straight boundary",
        "keeps eyes on the ball and twists his wrists very late to send the ball to the rope",
        "this is a very high full toss, and the batsman has sent it screaming over short third man with a neat reverse " +
        "paddle  even as he swivels away to avoid getting hit",
        "poor line to given the situation, good length down the pads, and he swipes it to the deep backward square boundary",
        "and finds the boundary this ball, whips a full ball angled in, beats midwicket's jump, and also a sliding " +
        "attempt  in the deep",
        "neatly done, very full outside off, not too much width, but the batsman opens the face and times it to deep " +
        "backward  point rope",
        "he's swung a boundary to deep square leg, reached forward and mowed it in the air",
        "down the pads, swept hard, and well wide of short fine leg",
        "the batsman trying to assert his flow, on the leg side now, this is shortish, be swings it off the front foot " +
        "and  times it to the deep square leg rope",
        "he wants a single after pushing to the leg side, non-striker is not interested, is half way down when he turns, " +
        "he  should have no chance, but he will instead get bonus runs, as the throw is nowhere near the keeper, let " +
        "alone the stumps",
        "he reverse sweeps a full ball from around off, and beats short third man with a crisp connection",
        "a really clean hit, the bowler continues to push it towards leg stump, and the batsman carts it in front of " +
        "square  leg once more",
        "sees him coming out, pushes it quick into the pad, the batsman swings in front of square and beats the man in " +
        "the  deep",
        "this has been cracked through extra cover, the batsman walks across to a full and wide one, and clobbers it",
        "short again, but in striking range this time, and he slams a pull in the air, to the deep midwicket boundary",
        "connects for some returns, the bowler digs in the short ball, and the batsman is waiting to pull it hard to " +
        "the  deep midwicket rope",
        "the batsman forehands it over mid-off for four. Not clean connection, but the man is up in the circle",
        "No energy behind this bowling. Gentle, on a length, wide, and the batsman rashes it over cover for four",
        "no sting behind it, and he has been dismissed through midwicket region. This is a slower bouncer.",
        "down the wicket, takes a length ball, swipes it through midwicket for four",
        "lovely square push drive. Full outside off, the batsman presses forward, covers the swing, and meets it with " +
        "an open  face. Bisects square cover and cover",
        "short and wide, outside off, the batsman might as well celebrate his birthday right now.",
        "this time it's a low full toss and he makes room and places it down to the vacant deep point region",
        "he doesn't need a sighter! This was too full and wide outside off, the batsman made room and smashed it wide " +
        "of cover,  the sweeper can't cut it off",
        " he makes room to a length ball and cuts him hard and fast past backward point, big gap there",
        "he whips a full delivery on middle and leg with such force that the ball blazes away wide of midwicket",
        "a pressure-relieving boundary, this was flighted on the pads, he was on his knee early and swept it firmly to " +
        "fine  leg",
        "this was nicely punched down the ground wide of mid-off off a full delivery",
        "outside edge but no slip, this was full and swinging away, he drove hard at it and the edge flew past the keeper" +
        " and  down to third man,",
        "in the air but very safe in the end, it was pitched up and he made a bit of room to carve that over the off " +
        "side,  bisected mid-off an cover very well, the field was up",
        "committed to the sweep early, tossed up on the pads and he gets down and sweeps with conviction",

        "overpitched and on the pads, clipped through midwicket for four",
        "overpitched ball outside off, eases that through cover for four, doesn't try to power that one, gets the " +
        "placement  right",
        "welcome boundary there, the bowler errs by bowling it too wide outside off and short, he makes room and slaps " +
        "it  down to deep point",
        "looked a bit ungainly but effective, he shuffled across his stumps, exposed all of them and slogged him just " +
        "wide  of short fine leg",
        " good placement again, third man was up, he had the width outside off to steer it wide of point",

        "that's emphatic! Short ball pulled powerfully to the deep midwicket boundary",
        "in the slot and he has hoicked it over the long-on boundary. Cleared his front leg and let the hands go",
        "that was clever. Waited on this shortish ball with just a little room and he dabbed it fine of short third man " +
        "and  it just skimmed away",
        "big full toss outside of and he's reverse pulled it over the head of short third man",
        "he essays a lovely, orthodox cover drive. All along the ground and stamped with his considerable power.",
        " there wasn't much room to get under this but somehow he does and the sweep skims hard and flat to the deep " +

        "powerfully, to the straight midwicket boundary. Lovely transfer of weight, swivelling through the hips",
        "super placement, that. It was tossed up wide outside off, and he had to get down really low, reach out a long " +
        "way, and use his wrists to execute that slog-sweep well enough to split the gap between deep midwicket and long-on",
        "flat and full on middle stump, and that is superb from the striker. Moved his front foot out of the way and " +

        "cover boundary. Bent at the knees to get down low and simply flat-batted it away",
        "full, a bit of movement outside off, and he gets a move on with a thick edge to the third man boundary. He was " +
        "making room, looking to launch it over cover",

        "effort, and it bounces down and rolls into the rope. Saved two runs, I suppose.",
        "super shot, this, from him. It's very full and straight, not too much swinging room, but he stayed fairly deep" +

        " but he drives at it away from the body. Along the ground it goes, past the lazy fielder at cover, who is " +
        "taken out of that fielding position immediately",

        "nicely played this time. This time he reacts to the ball as opposed to making the play first. This is short, " +

        "the batsmen seem to have a strategy to not let this bowler settle into a rhythm. He slog-sweeps first ball, and" +
        " clears midwicket easily",

        "the poor line is hurting his economy here. This is fired in short and wide, and he gets enough on the late cut" +
        " to place this between point and short third man",

        "Plays this right under his eye. Lovely timing",
        "wide length ball. Ordinary bowling really. On a length, not off pace, and he drives this on the up for four " +
        "all along the ground.",
        "another poor delivery. Short and wide with the third man. All he has to do is open the face and place it " +
        "between point and short third man. Four he gets",
        "misses the yorker by inches. This is somewhere between a yorker and a half-volley. On middle and leg, and he " +

        "and again. The batsman is at sea against quality bowling here. Dug in, he has no idea, throws his arms " +
        "up in self defence, and gets an edge wide of slip",
        "Smith takes a risk, gets a big outside edge that flies over point. Is the break he is looking for?",

        "places it straight of the man",
