        "enough  to clear the fielder in the deep",

        "short ball on off stump, he rocks back and smashes it way into the grass banks at cow corner",
        "lovely footwork as he leaves the crease to reach the pitch and a full swing of the arms brings up another " +

        "Ensured his front foot was not in the way and an effortless whip of the wrists sends the ball beyond the " +
        "square leg  boundary",
        "peppers the sight screen after skipping down the track.",
        "That has been launched into orbit ! We might as well bring a new ball right now...",

        "Clean as  a whistle",
        "mauled into the crowd behind deep midwicket! It was the slower ball and he'd picked it early and though the " +

        "the bowler bowls a terrible long hop and the striker shuffles across and mauls it miles into the square leg " +
        "boundary.  Surely he would have enjoyed that. ",
        "away the ball goes goes. Flat, hard and just over the ropes. On leg stump and he swung for the fences",
        "Overpitched outside off and he waded into the shot and timed it perfectly",
        "outside leg stump and he's helped it on its way. Lands among the his teammates in the dug out and he has a " +
        "big smile  on his face while punching gloves with his non-striker",
        "and he's sent packing over long-on. Races down and gets to the pitch. Doesn't bother about where it's going " +
        "and just  launches it into the night sky",
        "a glorious shot over extra cover. Didn't get to the pitch as much as he would have liked, and had to sort of" +
        " reach  for it, but his timing was still top-notch",
        "long-on watches it clear his head and thud into the advertising boards. Pitches it up in his arc and a big " +
        "back lift  comes down in a thunderous swing",
        "terrible line from the bowler. On the pads and he's been swept miles into the boundary behind square leg. A " +
        "batsman  of such class against this kind of bowling is no contest at all.",
        "what a strike! It was short and afforded him enough room to upper cut it and he's put enough muscle into it " +
        "to clear  the ropes",
        "into orbit! Races down the track to pick it up off a length and deposit well into the crowd behind long-on. " +
        "The  batsman has done away with defensive strokes",
        "did that go all the way? This was bowled short and sat up nicely for the batsman to biff it over midwicket, " +
        "the  question was whether the ball hit the boundary cushion on the full or on the half volley, the on-field " +
        "umpire asks the third umpire and after studying a few replays he calls it a six",
        "he's getting it off the middle now. This was tossed up amply on middle, he steps out a touch and stays leg " +
        "side of the ball to ease this over the ropes at extra cover. Pure class",
        "slower ball and this time the batsman has mauled it miles into the crowd! Planted his front leg down and didn'" +
        " bother with the niceties. Full-blooded swing of the bat and that brings us to the time out",
        "races down the track and smashes this over long-on. That's a pretty big blow in the context of the game",
        "oh my! He shuffled across and slog swept the flighted delivery into the stands behind midwicket. That was a " +
        "majestic hit",
        "he walks down and smashes the low full toss over long-off!",
        "he won't be smiling after this. It was full on off stump but the batsman had moved across and flicked it to " +
        "the long leg boundary. Looked completely at ease playing that",
        "that's over the ropes! It was length and sliding down leg, he was on his front foot and swiveled to help it " +
        "on it's way.",
        "whoa! That's emphatic! Chips down the track and drops this into the second tier behind long-on. Reached the " +
        "pitch and punished it",
        "I've seen him do that a couple of times. The bowler saw him making room outside leg and fired it wide outside " +
        "off. But he reaches out, the bottom hand comes off the bat and yet he blasts it over extra cover",
        " slower ball, picked up and hoisted over long-on. Bent his knees and slogged it away cleanly",
        "this time he misses his length and the batsman has swept him mightily into the stands behind square leg. Sunk " +
        "down into his knees and swung the arms quite freely. That was massive",
        "low full toss outside off, the batsman does what he has been doing so often. Backs away and hammers it over " +
        "the boundary. This time the crowd over extra cover scurries to return the ball",
        "switch hit warning! This was a low full toss on off stump, he changed his grip and swept it right-handed over" +
        " short fine leg, which was short third man until a second ago",
        "oops! The yorker ends up a full toss and Finch has mauled it over cow corner. Pulls off his helmet and has " +
        "the look of a man satisfied with his work. The bowler looks heartbroken with the mistake.",
        "down the track he comes, gets right to the pitch of this middle-stump ball, and extends his arms fully. You " +
        "know what happens when he does that. Soars over the bowler's head, over the straight boundary",
        "another length ball, angling into middle stump, clears his front leg again and swats it high over wide long-on",
        "allows him to get under the ball and get the elevation to easily clear the boundary at deep square leg",
        "length ball outside off, he clears his front leg and launches it high over long-off",
        "full on off stump, he moves his front leg out of the way and simply times the ball over the long-off boundary." +
        " Just a full, free swing of his arms",
        "full-toss on off stump, and he clears his front leg, sinks to one knee, and swats it away powerfully over " +
        "deep midwicket",
        "a bit of air, drops down on the perfect length for Anderson to muscle away for another big six over wide long-o",
        "Wow. Just a little pick-up shot, and it's carried all the way over the square leg boundary. It was full " +
        "from the bowler, and it swung into his pads, and it only took him a flick of the wrists to pick up six runs",
        "full outside off, and that's an interesting shot from the striker. Goes down on one knee, clears his front " +
        "leg, and ends up clearing the straight boundary with what could possibly be described as a slog-sweep over the " +
        "bowler's head",
        "a bit of air, and he is down the track in a flash to swing it away, with the turn, over the midwicket boundary",
        "shot! That is barely a short ball, but he is on the back foot in a flash, and swivels through his hips to " +
        "launch that high over deep square leg",
        "waist-high full-toss down the leg side, and the striker flicks his wrists and whips it away over the deep " +
        "backward square leg boundary. Effortless",
        "length ball on off stump, and this guy plays the Viv Richards shot. Plonks his front foot across and whips it " +
        "away over deep square leg",
        "and again that pick-up shot. It's a length ball, angling in towards off and middle. Gets his front leg across " +
        "and whips it, goes finer this time, over the head of the long leg fielder",
        "width again, but this time the length allows him to get elevation and easily clear the extra cover boundary",
        "full-toss on middle and leg, and the batsman whips those wrists again, launches it over wide long-on",
        "short ball outside off, he uses the bowler's inward angle and pulls it effortlessly over the midwicket boundary",
        "full on off stump, and he shuffles across and whips it over the wide long-on boundary.",
        "lovely shot. Inside-out. Just a chip. Confident of playing the shot against such pace. Presses the front " +
        "foot down, gets under a length ball, and chips it over mid-off",
        "this is poor bowling. This bowler has been getting away with this for far too length. Normal paced length " +
        "ball after normal paced length ball. The batsman connects this time. Over midwicket for six",
        "and he has middled this one. This was a straight roller on middle, the batsman sinks down to one-knee and " +
        "slog-sweeps over midwicket. Simply smeared that",
        "He nails it down. Flatter and on middle and leg, swiped away over long-on. Just about cleared the fielder",
        "top, top strike from the striker. This was slightly tossed up, takes the aerial route, lofting it inside-out " +
        "over the covers",
        "clears long off!. This was full and wide outside off, he clears his front leg and lifts it high in the air, " +
        "clears long-off. Not exactly middled, but they all count the same",
        "quick, long-hop from the bowler and it is duly dispatched over midwicket with a strong pull.",
        "length again, the batsman sinks to one knee and slog sweeps it, gets enough power to get it over a leaping " +
        "fielder at deep midwicket, who actually got a hand to it, the ball rounds off it and falls onto a poor little " +
        "spectator",
        "We have a firefight going on over here! Length on middle and leg, launched over deep midwicket and into the " +
        "orbit",

        " the long-on fence with nonchalance. #LikeABoss",

        "willow wades into leather. Back of a length and on the leg stump, he tonks it over over midwicket. Away she " +
        "sails over and the ball boy pouches it",
        "lofted out of the park for six! This one was pitched up on the pads with some inward movement and the batsman" +
        " smacked it to the cow corner boundary with a big follow through",
        "slow and full, it's in the zone for this batsman and he smashes it off the middle of the bat over cover to " +
        "send it all the way",
        "the slower ball? Doesn't matter, they all come and go the same! Picks it and goes down on a knee to launch it" +
        " over the long on boundary a few rows in the stands for a massive six",
        "bazooka blow! Runs down the track, manufactures a length back and launches it over deep midwicket. What fast " +
        "hands and foot work",
        "he has murdered that! Somebody call 100. Dropped short and the long-hop is dispatched away into one of the " +

        "outragerous! Full toss on middle, Baz goes low and laps it up and over the keeper's head",
