        "he is standing outside off and gets a high full toss, poor bowling this... the batsman gets a top-edge towards " +
        " long-on and gets a couple.. that's three runs. No free hit though.",
        "this one strays a little too close on middle and the batsman clips it off his hips to deep square leg. It's a " +
        "tough  chase down there but the fielder is game enough to slide and keep it to three. We have got a little " +

        "he gives him width and he chops it wide of backward point and they take three",

        "cut it off",

        "now he leans into a length ball going across him, hasn't timed it that well, and it slows down as it approaches" +
        " the  deep extra cover boundary, and is pulled back",
        "tries a huge slog sweep to one bowled outside leg, outside edge flies to short third man's left, he messes up " +
        "the  stop",
        "mis-hit falls safe. Another good bouncer, the batsman looks to pull, ends up to-ending it, and the edge lands " +
        "smack  in between long-on and long-off",
        "We could have had a run out here. The batsman continues to live on an edge, jumps out of the crease, gets a " +
        "thick  edge. it flies over cover, chased it down well, keeps it in, relays it to a fielder, who slips and " +
        "relays it to another, who spears the throw in, and the keeper messes the run-out up by flicking the bails " +
        "without collecting the ball",
        "the batsman is late into the pull again, and this time the top edge evades fine leg.",
        "shortish and angled into him, Finch moved outside leg and cuts it behind point. the sweeper pulls it back " +
        "right on the boundary",
        "short of a length, at the pads, tucked away nicely into the vacant spaces on the leg side, takes three runs",
        "shortens his length, mis-timed pull over midwicket. That is good enough for three runs",

        "comes down again and lofts it in the gap from off stump over the mid off fielder, who cuts it back with a " +
        "slide and saves one",
        "gets across to a shortish ball and whips it behind square, fielder saves the boundary with a dive",
        "he pushes and gets an inside edge that sneaks away fine after passing the stumps. The fielder slides in the " +
        "deep, but was he in contact with the ad boards while doing that. No, that's a clean stop, says the TV umpire",
        "this could have been another one of those tandem catches at the boundary, but that didn't work out well. It " +
        "was hit that high but not long, and the long-on fielder got under it, but pushed it back towards long off, but " +
        "it was not well-directed, goes over the other fielder. Don't think there was a need for that, as long off could" +
        " have completed the catch himself.. he had enough space",
        "overpitched outside off and he comes forward to drive it between cover point and short extra cover. The fielder " +
        "runs back from cover point to pull it back short of the rope",
        "he is crazy! There is no other word for it. The batsman charges out, has to reach out as this is slightly wide," +
        " slices it over cover and it looks set for a boundary.. but the fielder dives like a mad man and pulls it back.",
        "more chaos - the bowler sent down a short of length and slow ball outside off, the striker waited and scooped " +
        "it in the air behind square. Third man cuts it off and throws it quickly but it's an overthrow, and his partner " +
        "forces him to come back for the third as he ways way back in the crease after the second",
        "gets the sweep nicely past short fine leg, but deep square puts in a run and a slide to save a run, good " +
        "running too, to get the third",
        "wonderful work at the deep backward square leg boundary! He chased this sweep shot from fine leg, keeps this " +
        "one in with his first lunge, rolls over the boundary himself, then has to dive in to push the ball in again. " +
        "Smart work",
        "does not nail the yorker again. Too full and on middle and leg, swung away to cow corner. A bit of tag-team " +
        "work in the deep keeps it to three",
        "that's a lovely cover drive off the front foot through the covers in the gap. He came down for the bounce and " +
        "the fielder jumped near the boundary to cut it in",
        "slightly slower outside off, he guides it very late to beat short third man who runs to the boundary to slide " +
        "and save one",
        "the fielder makes a diving stop at sweeper cover, saves a run for his side",
        "similar length swinging towards the pads and the batsman steers the ball between short midwicket and square leg" +
        " for three",
        "turned away into the leg side. The bowlers will have to adjust their lines better",
        "fuller delivery outside off, the batsman leans into a push down the ground. Didn't quite time it as the bat face" +
        " turned on impact. Still good enough to demand the fielder to dive at the boundary",
        "he backs away, the bowler follows him. Still manages a cut that evades the dive of short third man. Gets up though" +
        " and chases after it to pull it back before the boundary",
        "shortish ball is pulled, the fielder runs a long way to his right from deep square leg, slides and keeps the ball" +
        " in. But the ball is rolling away to the rope, so he gets up and then cuts it in again! The crowd applauds...",
        "full outside off, he drives that firmly through the covers and a fumble in the deep gives them three",
        "short fine leg nearly pushed it away to the boundary, but a little gaffe has been saved by the bowler. Shortish" +
        " delivery, came onto him a little quicker as he went for a pull. Inside edge skews away behind him",
        "into the pads and he flicks that beautifully behind square on the leg side. The fielder runs from fine leg to " +
        "his left, slides the ball in. Then regains his balance and slides it in again to save one",
        "shimmies down the track and whips it over midwicket. The fielder covers plenty of ground in the deep, sprints " +
        "across to his right, puts in a slide and saves a run for his team",
        "tossed up and outside off, he aims to sweep it away. Skews it over the fielder at short fine leg off a top edge." +
        " The man there chases and slides. But he had hurt himself in the process, jamming his knee onto the turf. No " +
        "real damage done, though.",
        "pulled towards deep backward square leg, the fielder gives chase",
        "this one goes straight up, towards short third-man, but now the fielder drops it. This is a sitter. And what " +
        "more, they have taken three from this",
        "slower, but this is short too. He rocks back and pulls it over midwicket. Not much power behind that though, the" +
        " fielder runs around from deep square leg and boots it in",
        "another low full toss, he goes low and paddles it behind square leg. The fielder runs across and hauls it in " +
        "before the boundary",
        "movement away from the batsman outside off, he gets room and drives that off the back foot by going on his toes" +
        " and sends it past point in the gap",
        "in the air but wide of mid-off! Length delivery outside the off stump, he drove it on the up and it went just " +
        "to the right of mid-off, hey chased it from there and saved one",
        "tossed up on middle, he sets up for a ramp, does it connect well. The ball goes in the air in between the keeper" +
        " and first slip",
        "slower full ball on middle, sliced over the covers, who runs back from mid-off, puts in another outstanding slide" +
        " near the boundary and swats the ball in"
