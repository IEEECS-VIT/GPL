        "We could have had a run out here. The batsman continues to live on an edge, jumps out of the crease, gets a " +

        "relays it to another, who spears the throw in, and the keeper messes the run-out up by flicking the bails " +

        "this could have been another one of those tandem catches at the boundary, but that didn't work out well. It " +
        "was hit that high but not long, and the long-on fielder got under it, but pushed it back towards long off, but " +
        "it was not well-directed, goes over the other fielder. Don't think there was a need for that, as long off could" +
        " have completed the catch himself.. he had enough space",

        "runs back from cover point to pull it back short of the rope",
        "he is crazy! There is no other word for it. The batsman charges out, has to reach out as this is slightly wide," +
        " slices it over cover and it looks set for a boundary.. but the fielder dives like a mad man and pulls it back.",
        "more chaos - the bowler sent down a short of length and slow ball outside off, the striker waited and scooped " +
        "it in the air behind square. Third man cuts it off and throws it quickly but it's an overthrow, and his partner " +
        "forces him to come back for the third as he ways way back in the crease after the second",
        "gets the sweep nicely past short fine leg, but deep square puts in a run and a slide to save a run, good " +
        "running too, to get the third",
        "wonderful work at the deep backward square leg boundary! He chased this sweep shot from fine leg, keeps this " +
        "one in with his first lunge, rolls over the boundary himself, then has to dive in to push the ball in again. " +
        "Smart work",
        "does not nail the yorker again. Too full and on middle and leg, swung away to cow corner. A bit of tag-team " +
        "work in the deep keeps it to three"
