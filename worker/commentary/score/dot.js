        " pushed through quicker on off stump, he goes for the sweep but gets an inside edge",

        "the ball just scuttles underneath his bat",
        "charges down the track and the room he's made for himself allows the carve into the covers but the fielder " +
        "dives to his right and keeps it to none",
        "pitched up on middle and leg, the batsman plays across the line and is struck on the knee-roll. Big shout " +
        "from the bowler again but this time the umpire doesn't agree. It was tight",
        "a little more effort behind this delivery and the bounce beats the batsman's cut",
        "short but not quite wide enough, the batsman flat bats it down to mid-off.",
        "full and outside off, the batsman looks to blast it through the covers but mistimes it. The fielder cuts the " +

        "hint of inward dip to start off, the batsman negotiates it well by coming forward and presenting a straight bat",
        "That was a brilliant piece of bowling ! He must be rewarded with a wicket soon !",
        "Defended off the front foot, the bowler is keen to give the batsman a piece of his mind.",

        "And we have a comedy of errors here ! The batsman pulls away from a half hearted attempt, the ball hits the bat" +
        " nevetheless, a needless run is called for. A better throw from point would have the non striker out nine times" +
        " out of ten, but this time the ball just pops up to the man backing up, no run taken.",
        "A hint of movement, but the batsman strides forward to block.",

        "Played on the up, but the fielding captain has done his homework",
        "The intent was there, but the connection wasn't, the ball sails through to the keeper.",
        "he's struck on the front pad and he seemed pretty adjacent too! But the ball might just have gone over the " +
        "stumps. He was walking across and the bowler responded with a slower delivery just back of a length. Deceived " +

        "just outside off, pushed back to the bowler.",

        "fullish on off stump, defended towards short extra cover",
        "length ball on off and middle, defended back to the bowler",

        "excellent work from he keeper, runs forward and dives to catch the ball near where silly point may have stood, " +
        "but the ball popped off the front pad and nothing else. Missed a sweep at a quicker one",
        "nice change of pace, slow and dipping onto a good length on off stump. He comes forward to defend",
        "tossed up full on off stump, he pokes it into the covers",
        "down the track now, can't beat mid-off. He made room to punch the length ball with a straight bat, but he hit " +

        "lovely. Slower ball, full and angling across. He swings at it, looking to carve over the covers, and the ball " +
        "sneaks past his bat",

        "this time he gets the slower ball right, it's just outside off, swings and misses",
        "and again, this one's a bit wider and he swings across the line and only makes contact with air",
        "and another slower ball, and another swing and miss. He came down the track this time, but the lack of pace, " +
        "defeated his across-the-line swish."
