        "the ball just scuttles underneath his bat",
        "charges down the track and the room he's made for himself allows the carve into the covers but the fielder " +
        "dives to his right and keeps it to none",
        "pitched up on middle and leg, the batsman plays across the line and is struck on the knee-roll. Big shout " +
        "from the bowler again but this time the umpire doesn't agree. It was tight",
        "a little more effort behind this delivery and the bounce beats the batsman's cut",
        "short but not quite wide enough, the batsman flat bats it down to mid-off.",
        "full and outside off, the batsman looks to blast it through the covers but mistimes it. The fielder cuts the " +

        "he's struck on the front pad and he seemed pretty adjacent too! But the ball might just have gone over the " +
