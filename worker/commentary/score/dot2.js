    "low full toss on middle, whipped to midwicket on the edge of the circle",
    "there's the one he wants. The yorker a shade outside off, jammed back at the bowler amid great applause. That " +
    "delivery deserved every bit of it",
    "play and miss, is that the first? This was a back of a length delivery seaming away from his down the track smash",
    "another slower ball a shade outside off, looks for a slash but he doesn't beat the field at cover.",
    "saw the batsman running outside leg and flings down a widish yorker. But manages to stay inside the wide line. " +
    "Great presence of mind",
    "full on leg stump, nudged towards mid-on",
    "pulls the pace off, good intuition as he hurries down the track and is beaten.",
    "slower ball and it's away from the batsman's reach outside off. Goes for a slog and misses",
    "wanders away outside leg and he bends his back to beat him with a shortish delivery angled across",
    "it's the offcutter and he's beaten the batsman. His own fault for complicating matters by jumping away from the " +
    "ball. In the end, he can't reach the good length ball angled across him",
    "chance! chance.... not converted! goes for the yorker, keeps the striker quiet. Well, almost. the batsman wants a " +
    "single. There is none on offer because the ball has barely moved away from the pitch. A fielder races up, picks up" +
    " the ball, has ample time for the underarm throw. The batsman is well outside his ground.... but the throw misses." +
    " The simplest throw. The skipper is guffawing, the batsmen are livid. He could have run up and kicked the stumps " +
    "off",
    "gets down the track, and slips in his eagerness. Thumped back at the bowler",
    "yorker on middle, the batsman can't do anything about it. Jams his bat down and protects his stumps"
