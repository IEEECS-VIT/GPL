    "chance! chance.... not converted! goes for the yorker, keeps the striker quiet. Well, almost. the batsman wants a " +
    "single. There is none on offer because the ball has barely moved away from the pitch. A fielder races up, picks up" +
    " the ball, has ample time for the underarm throw. The batsman is well outside his ground.... but the throw misses." +
    " The simplest throw. The skipper is guffawing, the batsmen are livid. He could have run up and kicked the stumps " +

    "tossed up nice and slow outside off. He stretches forward to block into the off side",
    "nice flight on off stump. Comes forward, lets it spin, and defends with soft hands towards slip",

    "back of a length and outside off, plays an iffy sort of dab towards third man. Misses",

    "hits the fuller ball on off stump, drilled back at the bowler",
    "slower ball outside off, he was looking at third man but his slice doesn't connect",

    "back of a length outside off, rides the bounce and dabs it to backward point",
    "back of a length outside off, angling away further, and still the bowler appeals for lbw when he shuffles across " +
    "and fails to connect with a whip-pull",
    "shortish, some angle away from him. There's plenty of width already, so maybe making extra room was a bit " +
    "counter-productive, and he ends up flashing and missing without a stable base",
    "slower ball outside off, angling away. He tries to angle his bat and steer it to third man, doesn't make contact",

    "punch towards mid-on, ends up inside-edging into his pads",

    " there was a bit of confusion but the throw was sufficiently wide to keep him safe",

    " here",
    "slow, short, too wide to cut but not wide enough for the umpire to signal wide",
    "another slower ball outside off, better length this time. He looks to flat-bat it through the off side, " +
    "inside-edges into his body, and it nearly rolls onto the stumps",

    " pushes at the ball, searching for it",
    "quickish length ball outside off. He stays deep in his crease and defends",
    "full outside off, can't beat cover with his drive. That was right up, didn't give him too much scope to hit with " +
