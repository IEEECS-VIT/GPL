  "whoa what a catch! You beauty! The batsman gets a faint edge as he waits on the back foot and the man at slip dives  to his right to swoop it low with one hand.. Superb catch",
  "tries to cut this length ball over point, finds the man with a palpably mistimed shot",
  "very slow short ball, so he has to try and create his own momentum on the pull, but only manages to drag it tamely  to deep midwicket",
  "The fielder pulls out the chainsaw after clinging on to a flat, hard hit from him. It was full and the batsman  moved his front leg to give himself room, he struck it well but has pinned down the man in the deep",
  "slower ball on off stump, he goes for a slog but doesn't connect well enough. Deep midwicket holds on to a straight  forward catch",
  "overpitched just outside off, the batsman gets under it but hasn't gotten the elevation. Hits it hard and flat and  straight into the hands of long-on.",
  "tossed up on off stump, the batsman goes for the slog sweep. This has gained considerable height but there is a man  in the deep. A fielder camps under it and holds on to a simple chance. Touches gloves with his partner as he walks back",
  "he cannot believe he has top-edged such an innocuous delivery! It was short and sliding well down leg, should have  been pummeled over the fine leg boundary but instead the fielder runs back and takes a simple grab over his shoulder. That should tell us something about the durability of his hands",
  "this is a blinder! The batsman whacks the short of length delivery to deep midwicket, where the fielder lines  himself up for the catch.. but he slips.. Despite that, he somehow straightens his body on the ground, keeps an eye on the ball, arches his body back and takes a catch sitting down.. freakish catch.",
  "and he's gone... ironically to a ball that he timed so well.. Probably his best connection of the day.. It was full  and wide and he crashed it over point, but straight to deep point..the captain is pumped",
  "He is beaten by the extra bounce on this pitch.. the batsman wanted to clip it to the leg side, but this slower  delivery got big on him and the leading edge just popped up for the cover fielder..",
  "tries to be cheeky but pays the price... He moves across the stumps to flick the full delivery fine, but only lobs  it to short fine leg fielder",
  "how far has that gone! not too far unfortunately for the batsman. He made room, got a slower ball, lifted it towards  deep midwicket and looked like he made a good connection... But that went straight into the bucket hands of the fielder",
  "He tries to whack this inside out, with the spin, to the stands. The idea was right, the execution wasn't as he  failed to get distance on this.. The catch is comfortably taken at deep extra cover",
  "tries to hammer the ball towards long-on, but he fares even worse. He could only get it as far as mid-off.",
  "that's the end of him as he slaps a length delivery straight to long-off. He didn't really time it as well as he  would have liked.",
  "leading edge to cover point now! Fuller on off, with some shape on it. He looks to play a loose push towards mid-on  but closes the face too early. The fielder takes a simple catch",
  "he top-edges it to the man in the deep on the leg side",
  "shortish again and the batsman goes for a pull. Only succeeds in getting a top edge that soars into the night sky  before settling in the hands of cover",
  "goes straight to long-off ! The bowler pulled his length back a little, the batsman still went after it. But he  picked out the fielder. Punches his bat in disgust",
  "straight to long-off. The batsman chooses a very bad shot there as he looks to smite it down the ground. Gets it  off the bottom of the bat, which turns in his hands, and he controls a simple catch",
  "is forward and looks to clip through midwicket, closes the face too early and gets a leading edge that is pouched  by the bowler himself. Punches the air and screams in triumph",
  "slowed it up this time and the extra flight dupes him. The batsman doesn't hold back as he goes over the top again.  This time it's the leading edge that gains more height than distance. Long-off leaps up to hold down a pretty good catch. Think he was very worried about the rope, but it was well behind him",
  "goes for the slog sweep and he's picked out the man in the deep! He had to drag a good length ball that went on  with the arm, which hampers his timing and the man at deep square leg holds on easily",
  "he was looking to cut it into the gap behind point but the ball gained just a little more bounce and he steered it  straight into the hands of the square fielder",
  "he's picked out deep square leg, who hardly had to move! He looked quite dangerous skipping down the track and he  connected pretty cleanly as well. But he forgot all about the placement. A terribly soft dismissal considering the situation",
  "the slower ball has him! It's not a short one though. The batsman backed away to flay the good length offcutter  through the off side and gets a thick outside edge that lobs to short third man. The fielder dives forward and plucks a pretty neat take",
  "the batsman throws his head back! He's spliced a slower, back of a length ball down the throat of mid-off. He was  trying his best to make some room to lash it quite a bit squarer than where it ended up but the ball struck him a little too high on the bat and he wasn't able to instill any power into the shot",
  "Three men were hunting down that catch, it was about to land just out of reach but he dives and sticks out both hand  and plucks it out of it's trajectory! It was on a length but was hit it a little too high on the bat. It was a very difficult skier somewhere beyond the circle in the midwicket region but he was quick enough and athletic enough to pull it off",
  "full and slow delivery mishit over midwicket, a fielder runs across from long on and takes a tumbling catch",
  "he backs away, the delivery is angled in full and the batsman lifts it tamely to mid off",
  "this has gone miles in the air as the batsman steps out, is not to the pitch of one that straightens, but goes through  with the shot, long off settles under it",
  "tried to fetch this short of a length ball from way outside off and flat-bat it down the ground but he has not got  enough elevation on the mishit, mid off times his jump to take a sharp catch",
  "he keeps it on a good length, around off, the batsman tries to force it square on the leg side, misses and the  bowler hits off with slight away movement",
  "this has kicked up from just back of a length, the surprised batsman jabs at it and it pops tamely to point",
  "strikes early, length ball moving away outside off, the batsman stands and wafts, and feathers it behind",
  "full into leg stump, the batsman clears front leg, gets under it and lifts it straight to long on",
  "swats this full delivery flat and straight to long off! Brilliant judgement !",
  "and he's managed to hold on! The batsman swats a length ball to long off, he comes forward and across and takes it  quite safely",
  "slogs probably as hard as he can, but just fails to clear deep midwicket, where the fielder moves to his right to  take a well-judged catch very close to the rope",
  "he top-edges it to the man in the deep on the leg side",
  "played away from the body and he miscued it to long-off",
  "this was tossed up outside off and the batsman made room to carve that over cover, the fielder ran to his right at  cover and took the catch easily at the edge of the circle",
  "straight to deep midwicket, the batsman attempts to slog that for a six over deep midwicket, fetches it from outside  off, it went flat to the fielder,",
  "gets the line and length spot on this time! The away swinger gets him, swung away from the middle stump, the batsman  was compelled to go for the drive, thick outside edge to the keeper",
  "made a lot of room and charged down the track looking to clear the off side, unfortunately he made too much room  and the ball spooned off the bottom of the bat, the fielder ran backwards at mid-off and hung on on the dive just as the ball was leaving him, the fielder covered a lot of ground getting to the ball, amazing stuff",
  "has pulled off quite a stunner! The batsman looked to clear the straight boundary, it was high in the air and he  was running back from mid-off, the running catches are the toughest, hung on to it and fell backwards",
  "this time the fielder takes a terrific catch, the batsman has flopped, a length ball and he wanted to play that  inside-out, bat turns as he plays that and the ball loops towards cover, the fielder has some ground to cover, he sprints to his left and pouches that one",
  "gets him with the slower ball, it was short and teh batsman swiveled and looked to pull it to fine leg, just shaved  the face of the bat on the way to the keeper",
  "nearly spilled that! Slower ball and short, the batsman rocked back to pull and it was flat over square leg, the man  in the deep ran to his left and grabbed at it, it popped out and he tried taking it in the second attempt and it slipped out again but he managed in the third attempt",
  "this was a length ball and the batsman made room to clear long-on, he closed the face of the bat as he made contact  and hence didn't hit it well enough",
  "this was a length ball, the batsman stayed at the crease and looked to clear long-on, didn't get the distance, the  fielder takes the skier well in front of the rope",
  "he mishits this full delivery, it goes straight and high, stays airborne for an age, but long on judges it neatly",
  "this is a sharp, tumbling take at deep backward square leg, the batsman swung a short of a length ball and the  fielder has not had to move much",
  "the batsman sees deep point, and he will take him on of course, slices this widish back of a length ball straight  to the man.",
  "advances out to a flat one and lifts it straight into the hands of deep midwicket",
  "he slashes this short of a length ball in the air and straight to third man",
  "The bowler cranks it up on this ball, the batsman turns on one leg, trying to lift it over square leg, but he is not  so lucky this time, loops straight to the man",
  "this is outside off now, the batsman gets down on his knee and swings, and inside-edges it into his stumps",
  "finds deep midwicket this time, it was shortish, angled in, right in the pulling zone, he swung it from outside the  crease, and into the safe hands of long on",
  "and the plan has worked to perfection, he gets a back of a length ball down the pad, around hip height, tucks it  fine instinctively, and there is a leg slip waiting to accept the gift",
  "terrific delivery, the bowler leaps as this one kicks from just back of a length around off, straightens on the  batsman, he has to play at this, prods, and the thick edge flies low to widish slip",
  "Nothing behind this shot. Caught at long-on",
  "gets a touch too under a length ball, lofts this towards long-off where th fielder takes it overhead",
  "This is a slower-ball length ball hit wide of long-off, but the fielder makes so much ground he doesn't even have  to dive.",
  "pitches this up on middle and leg, drilled to long-on where the fielder times his leap to perfection to take this  overhead",
  "on a length, just outside off, he lazily drives into it. Makes no attempt to keep it down, nor is he trying to hit  it out of the ground. Provides long-off a sitter.",
  "He is hurried into this shovel-pull. Mostly because the ball is not short enough, and he ends up slicing it to  square leg",
  "he can't believe what he's done, he turns back to the umpire and waits for the crooked finger, this was pitched up  on the off stump, just the right length, the batsman comes forward and there's a thick outside edge to the keeper, it was very obvious, the bowler waits and waits and the umpire does the rest",
  "that was a soft dismissal! This was a length ball outside off and the batsman looked to clear mid-off but it went  off the bottom half of the bat and as a result it went rather tamely to mid-off",
  "finds the fielder at long-on, makes room and it's mistimed and it is taken at long-on",
  "This was a length ball and he made room to smash this over the off side, top edge and the keeper gets under the skier",
  "this was a friendly full toss, whipped it straight to deep midwicket",
  "finds the man in the deep on the on side, this was a slower ball and bowled a bit short, Warner rocks back and pulls  in front of square but finds the man at deep midwicket, went straight to him",
  "found the fielder with precision, the batsman was down on his knee to slog, played it flat and found the fielder  at deep square leg",
  "that's a soft dismissal! But that wasn't a terribly good delivery either, this was short and wide outside off, the  invitation was there for the cut but he could only hit it straight to the man at cover, didn't time it well and an easy catch in the end",
  "pushed through on middle and leg as he rocks back and goes for an almighty pull. Hasn't connected it properly and  the fielder at deep midwicket takes a tumbling catch to break the opposition's partnership",
  " one slog too many for the batsman and he has to walk back dismissed off a full toss. Sought the wide yorker again  but it ends up a lovely delivery to be smacked over the covers but he swung across the line and got a leading edge which is taken by the man in the covers",
  "scooped it straight into the hands of the man at short fine leg. It did not allow the batsman the pace he wanted.  Walked right across his stumps to manufacture a big shot and perishes",
  "holes out at long-off ! Another full toss outside off but the batsman can't get the meaty part of the bat on this.  Lofts it down the throat of the fielder",
  "safely taken! The batsman was lured into playing an expansive drive on the up and he was an age too early into the  shot. Gets a leading edge and perishes in quite a tame fashion",
  "taken at long-off! This was full on middle and the batsman made a little room to blast it down the ground. Didn't  get as much bat as he would have liked as the fielder rushes in and dives forward to pick up a neat, low catch! That was plucked inches off the ground.",
  "caught at the edge of the circle at cover! Fuller delivery on off stump and the batsman tries to force the pace by  shoveling it over the infield. The ball was too full to get under as well as he would have liked.",
  "goes straight up in the air and the bowler himself takes the catch, albeit after a bit of a juggle. ",
  "what a soft dismissal, caught down the leg side! The captain high-fives his bowler. The batsman shuffled across to   try and glance it fine but the ball, just short of a good length, runs off the face and the keeper collects another simple catch",
  "a shortish ball down the leg side, wasn't the most threatening delivery, the batsman wanted to pull that away, can only glove it away, easy catch for the keeper",
  "slower ball on off stump, he goes for a slog but doesn't connect well enough. the fielder is at deep midwicket and holds on to a straight forward catch",
  "pulls out the chainsaw after clinging on to a flat, hard hit from the batsman. The bowler is on a roll here. It was full and he moved his front leg to give himself room, he struck it well but has pinned down the man in the deep",
  "tossed up on off stump, the batsman goes for the slog sweep. This has gained considerable height but there is a man in the deep. A fielder camps under it and holds on to a simple chance. Touches gloves with his partner as he walks back",
  "overpitched just outside off, the batsman gets under it but hasn't gotten the elevation. Hits it hard and flat and straight into the hands of the man at long-on.",
  "charges at the bowler who pulls the length back, and the top edge flies over the keeper's head. The slip runs back to take an easy catch",
  "short ball, he has sent it straight down the throat of deep midwicket. The bowler plays a part in yet another wicket. Just one of those shots, though. The ball deserves to be hit, but it has perhaps skidded on to him, and he is hurried into the pull. Easy catch for the man at deep midwicket",
  "it is a goodie from the man in the deep. THe batsman backs away again to go over extra, but is cramped up this time, which means he ends up hitting it mush straighter than he wants to. The fielder camps on the fence, and takes this coolly overhead",
  "It's onto the batsman quicker than he expected. He was in an uncomfortable half-forward position, no position from which to pull - it wasn't short enough for that either - and he top-edged it high in the air, simple catch for the man at deep square leg",
  "down the track now, doesn't reach the pitch, and he picks out that man again. The bowler tossed it up slower and wider, and Tare had to reach out in front of his body to hit that, ended up hitting it straight down long-off's throat",
  "the captain had two slips in place, and the batsman has steered this one straight into first ones hands. Back of a length outside off, left the batsman off the pitch. Simply poked at it with an open face, a nothing shot, and it flew off the outside half of the bat and into the fielder's palms at a comfortable chest height",
  "he never looked comfortable against him, trying to manufacture shots. Yet again he tries a shot that is not on. Looks to go over mid-on, but this length ball is too close to him, and he has sent this straight down mid-on's throat.",
  "He tries one shot too many. The bowler has run his fingers on this. Slightly off-pace with another forceful shot, and he is early into it. The outside edge is pouched by the keeper",
  "this is not the smartest bit of batting. He has fallen to an old little trap from the skipper. More experienced batsmen do better. The captain has guessed that off side is his game, and has placed a deep point and opened the third man region. The next three balls: a slog into the leg side, an attempt to open the face, and another slog. This slog goes a mile in the air and settles with the man at extra cover. You have got to make them work harder for your wickets",
  "soft. Softest ever. Any softer and it would be molten wax. He looks like Duncan Fletcher giving catching practice to the slips and point. Just opens the face on a short and wide ball to give point an easy catch",
  "he is not looking at the ball as he pulls. There has been a plan to bowl at his head, he has managed to keep it down twice, but this time he is late into the pull. The head falls away, he is not looking at it, and the ball comes and hits the bat as opposed to the hat hitting the ball. Easy catch for midwicket",
  "slogs, mis-hits a length ball, he top-edges it to deep midwicket, and the striker has done half his job of getting off strike, but has managed no run off it. Easy catch for deep midwicket",
  "strikes early. The batsman perishes. He races down the track, manufactures a length ball, skews it off the bottom of the bat. That is a dolly for mid-off as the batsman makes a hash of the lofted stroke",
  "and he has nicked off! THe bowler is on a roll #like a boss. This was a teasing fullish ball sliding outside off, the batsman is lured into pushing at it and the outside edge is held by the keeper",
  "and the bowler takes down his man! This was dragged short and wide outside off, so he seeks to pull it away. He has to settle with a thick top-edge. Straight down the gullet of deep third man ( not literally). Eys hopeful, he looks back at the umpire and waits as the umpires check for a possible no-ball. It is a legal delivery and his knock has been cut short",
  "in the action again, this time pulling off a smart-looking catch. Full toss around the leg-stump line, he goes down on one knee, but does not get enough power behind the slog-sweep. Holes out to long-on. He snapped it, realised that he was close to the ad boards, and then regained his balance and pouched it on the rebound. The second grab does it for him in the end.",
  "and he's gone! The bowler delivers the customary early breakthrough. The coaching outfit look pleased in the dug-out. This was full and sliding across, who chases it only to nick it through. The outside edge is well held by Sanju, diving across to his right.",
  "the fielder completes a superb catch. He backed away and aimed to smash this back of a length ball away over the off side, but does not get hold of it. Mid-off moves to his left, dives and snaffles the take",
  "and he finally has a wicket! This one lifts from a length outside off, the batsman looks to go over the leg side. His crude heave translates into a leading edge, which is swallowed by deep third man after running to his right",
  "perishes after being hoodwinked by the bowler's change of pace. Oh wait, the umpires are checking for a possible no-ball. He may have had some part of his heel behind the bowling crease. Aims to go big and holes out to long-off",
  "what an insane catch! Superb tag-team work from the bowling team. What presence of mind. The fielding has veered from ordinary to extraordinary tonight. This is an extraordinary assisted hokey-pokey catch. On a length and on the leg stump, the batsman attacks it and sends it over midwicket. The fielder leaps, plucks out his right hand and takes it. But his balance is awry as he looks to go over the ad boards. However, he has the presence of mind to tag it to a nearby fielder, who dives across and pouches it",
  "and the batsman picks out cover now. Good catch st long on, for it was travelling at the rate of knots. Too full and outside off, he flays a drive. The fielder hops up and cover and takes it around chest-height. Ouch, that must sting.",
  "in the air and the catch is taken, at long on! The batsman slapped the short ball from outside off down the ground. The ball was in the air for some time and became an easy catch for long on",
  "it's high, it's not off the middle of the bat, and he's taken at deep midwicket. The batsman slog-sweeps the fullish delivery from middle and leg, it goes high enough for the fielder to take it easy in the deep",
  "not long before he targets that leg-side boundary, but he's caught in the deep! He went back in the crease to whip that short of length ball to the long-leg boundary, gets some distance but long leg takes it right at the boundary. The bowler roars, he has some whiskers too",
  "that goes high and straight down the ground, a fielder runs to his left from long on and takes a good catch on the move. Back of length it was, our culprit slogged to the leg side and got a leading edge",
  "loud appeal for a catch down leg and the finger's gone up, he is gone! Good pace and bounce for the short ball as it was going down leg, he pulled, got some glove before the keeper took a good catch",
  "the bowler strikes! The slower ball works for him. Too full and wide outside off, perhaps, looks to loft-drive it over the infield. But ends up slicing it to backward point. Undone by the slow off-cutter",
  "runs down the track but mis-hits the lofted stroke, holes out to long-off, who follows the ball, watches it all along and pouches it safely",
  "holed out to deep midwicket, where the fielder leaps near the boundary and completes a sharp catch. Short and on the leg stump as the batsman backs away and the bowler follows him. The striker got a good chunk of wood on the pull, but came second to a brilliant piece of fielding.",
  "and he strikes, the hitting effort has been cut short. Pushed through quicker on off, looks like it went with the angle. The batsman steps out, does not get hold of the lofted-hit, skews it in the air. The diving ball settles under floodlit skies at long-on.",
  "and he is gone now! This was flat and quick on off, he aims to slog it away from there. Low-percentage cross-bat swipe. Miscues it to deep midwicket",
  "perishes now. Arm-ball flat and quick on middle and leg, the striker seeks to pull it away. Not a full-blooded one, not all that well-timed, neither did he impart power to it. A fielder snaps it up at deep backward square",
  "bat undone by leather.. The umpires check for a possible no-ball, just a customary check, all fine though. Slipper delivery sprayed wide outside off, the batsman wants to attack it, but can only edge it thickly to his left. Might have been the change of pace, there.",
  "Where is the keeper? Fuller and straighter, the batsman picks it up from there and whips it straight down the gullet of deep midwicket. Simple catch for the man there. The off-speed ball pulled the wool over him and the bowler exults",
  "He nips down the track, the bowler is smart enough to shorten his length. The ball hits the splice of the bat as opposed to the bat hitting the ball. Spoons it through to the fielder at the covers, he moves to his left and grasps it. The bowler is pumped after drawing the error from the batsman",
  "he has to depart now. This was short and sliding across the batsman, who had initially made room to go over the covers. He makes a meal of the shot and nicks it through to the man behind the stumps. Poor, poor batting this. The keeper takes it at head height",
  "the bowler gives this some air, the batsman aims to loft it away and holes out to the man at long-off. Definition of a dolly. He skied it off the base of the bat",
  "On a length and outside off, carved into the hands of deep point",
  "the slower ball has worked, he has given a catch to mid off! He made some room for the length delivery, wanted to smash it down the ground and mistimed it for a high catch as mid-off came under it comfortably",
  "gets a top edge and the fielder takes a spectacular running catch at deep backward square leg to get this wicket! He pulled the short ball, got a top edge and it went pretty high. The fielder had to run a long way to his right, another was also coming from deep midwicket but he got both hands to it in time",
  "straight to deep midwicket, he didn't have to move an inch! Pressure seemed to have got to him as he played a cross-bat slog to the length delivery and found the man in the deep",
  "Pitched it up just outside off, Smith came down again and looks like he didn't pick that one, lofted it down the ground and found long on",
  "he's stumped! An unwanted shot charged again for the widish delivery and missed it completely as it came in. Easy work for the keeper",
  "Pitched on length outside off and moving in sharply, the batsman hardly moves his feet and was trapped right in front of middle and leg, that was plumb",
  "holed out, he gets him with a long hop! It was short and flat, the batsman smashed it to the leg side and found long on.",
  "he swings and finds the man at deep backward square. This was on the pads, the batsman picks it up and hits it right into the palms of the man in the deep. Simple catch, he did not even have to budge.",
  "strikes to get rid of the striker! Pushed through flat and quick on middle, the batsman hunts for a slog-sweep after going down on one knee. Gets a top-edge and shoots it up in the air. A fielder comes forward from point and pouches it",
  "and he pulls off a stunner! One-handed... This was fuller and on middle, looks like a gripper. The batsman wants to clip it away to the leg and loops it into the air off a leading edge. The fielder flies to his right from short cover, both feet off the ground, and plucks it out one-handed. Whoa.",
  "Caught at sweeper cover. This was on a length and outside off, he slices it high into the air. A fielder settles under it at sweeper cover. More off the toe-end of the bat, that",
  "Short and wide outside off, he steps away, winds up for a big blow and skews it to the air. The man at covers moves to his left and collects it",
  "Banged in short and rises awkwardly on the batsman, who goes for the pull. He can only splice it in the air. The man at cow corner rushes in and completes a smart catch at midwicket. He tumbles onto the ground after taking it",
  "has had one leading edge too many, wanted to work a length ball off the pad, ended up hitting it high and limply to mid off",
  "he has picked out long off, skipped out and went with the spin, but was not too close to the pitch and did not get the distance",
  "strikes with a slower one, the batsman tried to make some room and loft it over extra cover, but badly mishit it, and it is an easy catch at mid off",
  "and now he strikes, he kept moving the line across the batsman, this one was floated up outside off, moved away a tad, he pushed at it away from the body, and the lone slip was in business",
  "could have been a flicked six but he could not get enough distance on this full one and deep midwicket tumbles forward to take it",
  "Cross-seamer from the bowler. Shortish and rushes on outside off to ruin the attempted pull. He lobs it up in the air, a fielder runs across to his right from mid-off, dives and snags a smart catch",
  "and he has holed out, no more hitting for him! This was pushed across him, he aims to loft it straight down the ground. But does not connect properly, slices it high into the air. The man makes good ground from deep cover, runs across and snaffles the take",
  "outside off and he strikes! The batsman runs down the track, seeks to smash another mighty blow. But has to settle with a slice, which is swallowed up by the fielder at the covers",
  "and the bowler is delighted. The batsman chips down the track, does not middle the lofted strike. The fielder just about hangs onto it at long-on",
  "and he takes a sharp catch. The batsman wants to whack it over the leg side, skews it off the bottom of the bat and holes out to long-off, where the fielder takes it at the edge of the boundary",
  "banged in short and rushes onto tuck him up for room. He was caught between pulling and pulling out of the stroke, gets into an awkward tangle and guides it to the fielder at deep third man off the bottom part of the bat",
  "goes deep in the crease, but holes out. This was very full from the bowler on off, the batsman shuffles across a bit, goes deep in the crease and swings it. He runs in from midwicket, keeps his eyes on the ball, dives forward and pulls off a superb catch. The umpires check for a no-ball and the delivery is okay, the batsman has to go",
  "This was pushed through, the striker aims to swipe it away. Does not get it off the meat of the bat. Skies it off a top-edge, which is held by the man at cover",
  "And the bowler strikes, good retort. This one rears up from a back of a length and slides across the batsman with the angle. He has a loose waft at it and edges it through to the keeper, who moves to his left to pouch that.",
  "delivers the breakthrough, the batsman has given it away. Fuller and outside off, he opens his bat-face and looks to steer through vacant slip, who dives to his right and plucks a smart one-handed catch. The umpire check for a no-ball, which is okay, the catch is also clean.",
  "he picks out short cover perfectly! The bowler floats this outside off, he goes hard on the drive but cracks it straight to the man at short cover",
  "how does he always take such catches?! This ball he did not middle, pulled the back of length ball down the ground, got a leading edge right over the bowler's head and he ran from mid off to his left to dive backwards and catch it as if that's what he does every morning after waking up",
  "and he is gone too, another catch down the ground! Made some room, maybe the bowler anticipated it and pitched outside off, the batsman swung his arms wildly, didn't middle it and found the fielder for a simple catch at the edge of the circle",
  "the ball finds a fielder! Short of length ball towards the stumps, the batsman cleared his front foot and threw his bat at it, got a leading edge and the fielder ran a few steps to his right from fly slip for an easy catch",
  "and out! Slower through the air and angled in, he slams it down the ground and finds long on for an easy catch",
  "slower ball brings the fall! He picked the ball from around off, it was fullish, to the leg side and the fielder took a simple catch around his left shoulder at deep midwicket",
  "full toss gets a wicket now! Attempted yorker is a full toss on the pads, he flicks it in the air and deep backward square leg takes a straightforward catch.",
  "straight down long-off's throat! He came down the track to take it on the full, did not succeed, and mistimed that one down to the fielder's throat for an easy one",
  "another mistimed shot, another wicket! This was flat and well outside off, but still slog-swept to the leg side, got a top edge very high and took the catch going back a few steps from midwicket",
  "there we go! Lovely line just outside off and he was tempted by third man a bit too much. Flashed the angled blade and presents slip-catching practice to a diving widish first slip",
  "done him in! He seemed to be tiring to be lazy in the shot here. Fooled by the slower ball that holds on the pitch. Was into his slog way too early and the leading edge settles into the hands of cover. Canny bowling here",
  "what a catch! This was a long hop that was sailing beyond the midwicket boundary, but he waits for it. He times his jump with insane precision and thrusts his hands over head and grabs a stunner with the boundary inches from his feet as he comes down! Boy, is he pumped!",
  "how soft was that? This was back of a length and comes in on middle and leg, he aims to flick it away. Instead he chips it to short midwicket. This may have stuck in the pitch and stopped on him. He rehearses the flick as he walks back",
  "He takes pride in calling keeping his primary skill and he shows it off. This looked like one that gripped in the pitch, did not come onto the batsman, bounced extra as well. He looks to guide it away through the slip cordon but makes a mess of it. Off the face of the bat and pouched by the keeper, diving across full-length to his right. End of a charming cameo from this player. Replays show that it was the back-of-the-hand slower one",
  "flashes, connects and nicks off. This was on a length and angling away outside off again, he swishes and manages a bottom-edge, which is gobbled up easily by the keeper",
  "he's taken a super catch diving forward! The bowler waits after shovelling the wide, tossed up through the off side. But the fielder swooped in from point, threw himself forward and to his right and takes a lovely grab. Third umpire confirms and off he goes.",
  "picks out long-off! Easily done by the bowler. It was overpitched, but was wide. Had to reach out for it and that ruins his timing. The striker went through with the stroke and pays for it",
  "caught at long-off! He was clearing that front leg again and the bowler bowls it full and wide to try and evade his reach. Splices it off the bottom of the bat and  was easily under it",
  "he perishes! Back of a length and on middle and leg, the batsman chips it feebly, a fielder runs forward from midwicket and completes a good catch. The extra lift from this delivery foiled the stroke",
  "strikes! On the customary back-of-a-length side, the striker hunts for another pull. This was not all that short to warrant the stroke. He can't connect well this time, much like the first attempt. Gets a bottom-edge onto the thigh, rebounds to the man at a widish slip position",
  "sharp work from the bowler! The batsman wants to whip this length ball on middle and leg away, does so. But the fielder dives to his right at square leg and pulls off a smart, low catch",
  "and this time the batter has holed out, he pulls off a stunning catch, diving forward from sweeper. The batsman makes room and carves it in the air, the fielder runs forward, takes the flat hit and tumbles onto the ground. The batsman examines the bottom of the bat as he trudges back",
  "Crucial strike. The bowler delivers another short bumpy ball, the batsman backs away and mishits the attempted cut, finds backward point. He hops up and takes it",
  "This was fuller and on middle, whipped away straight down the gullet of long-on. Not middled, hit high on the bat and he holes out",
  "He bends down for a massive slog-sweep over leg, but can only skew it to long-off off the base of the bat.",
  "hey hustle for a couple, fine throw from long off, the keeper whips the bails off. This low full toss was drilled down the ground. He wants a couple, the fielder collects the ball quickly from long-off and fires a throw to the keeper. He moves to his left, gathers it on the second bounce and catches the batsman short",
  "this is an outstanding catch! The striker misses the yorker outside off, ends up bowling a full toss. Below the waistline, though, the TV umpire confirms it as well. The batsman backs away and slices it. The bowler leaps across to his left from backward point and completes a memorable catch. He also intercepted a four there",
  "the danger man is gone off the top edge, the crowd is happy, flags are waving! He shuffled across a long way to off, swept the length delivery against the turn and got a top edge high in the air behind the keeper fine on leg. The fielder went to his right from short fine leg to take it nicely",
  "can't clear the fielder this time and finds long off! Swept the fullish ball straight down the ground, not quite from the middle, and holed out!",
  "The fielder has taken a very good catch at deep midwicket, the batsman is gone. He saw the short of length delivery and played a half-flick-half-pull to the leg side, and the man had to jump in the deep to catch it over his head",
  "slightly similar, slightly different, same result in similar fashion! Back of length ball coming in, lofted to the leg side and he runs in this time to catch it easily",
  "holes out straight to sweeper cover! Short and wide, there's an opportunity to swing his arms, he does, and finds the man in the deep",
  "chipped in the air and he takes a very good catch running in from mid off, the bowler gets a breakthrough! It was fullish on off, he looked to play it down the ground but played it early and the ball lobbed towards mid-off, who ran in and dived forward to get his fingers under it",
  "he holes out, is that the beginning of the end? Full delivery on the stumps, He put his back foot in the crease and tonked it straight down to long-on",
  "he has missed him previously, but he has his man now! The batsman looks to pull this flatter delivery over midwicket but gets hurried by the ball, doesn't get it off the middle and lobs an easy chance to mid-on",
  "that's the end of him, the extra bounce does it. The bowler slants it across the batsman at good pace and the batsman looks to steer it to third man. But this is too close and he feathers an edge to the keeper",
  "another one goes down! Superb catch by the man at long-off. The striker looked to attack the flighted delivery and almost beats the fielder, who is a bit inside the boundary and has to leap up to grab that one. He falls backwards, but safely inside the boundary",
  "shortish ball, too quick for the batsman to pull, hurries through, and he top-edges it high in the air for the fielder to take a sprawling catch at long leg",
  "full outside off, and he picks out backward point. Makes room to slice it away, hits it fairly well, but straight to the fielder, who catches it just above head height",
  "taken! That was full and wide and he had a big slog at it, got a thick outside edge that was going a long way to the right of the keeper, but he dived across, at full stretch, and came away with the ball in his right glove",
  "fullish outside off, and he simply doesn't time that. Looked to hit it over mid-off, and I think that hit the outside half of his bat, and he ended up chipping it straight to mid-off",
  "short outside off, and he has simply helped that into third man's hands. Leaned back to ramp it, and picked out the fielder",
  "shortish outside off and he's gone! Looked for that late dab again, ended up sending a thin edge into the keeper's gloves",
  "It was a long-hop, or a longish-hop at any rate, and he pulls it straight down the throat of deep midwicket",
  "slower ball slanting away from off stump, and the keeper takes a good low catch to his right, after the batsman looked to slog it over the leg side and only managed a top-edge",
  "got him! That was cleanly struck, clearing his front leg and hitting the full middle-stump ball down the ground, but didn't get enough elevation to clear long-on, who timed his jump perfectly to catch it two-handed, over his head",
  "and he strikes. Very full on middle and leg. The striker looks to hoick it away over the leg side, doesn't really get hold of it, picks out deep square leg",
  "goes for the slog-sweep now and he's holed out to deep midwicket. Just a bit of extra bounce from middle and leg and it produces the top edge",
  "loopy delivery, and that's produced the breakthrough. Nice line from the bowler, challenged to hit him against the angle, and he top-edged the attempted slog-sweep high in the air, drops into the waiting hands of long-on",
  "full and wide outside off, and the striker gets under it and slices it straight into sweeper cover's hands.",
  "gone this time, his preferred back of a length doing it, the striker did not seem to be sure about the pull as he took it from outside off, awkwardly top-edged it behind square on leg, the keeper got under it safely",
  "catching practice for extra cover and the batsman has squeezed a full one straight to the man",
  "quite full now, and he has drilled it straight to the man at long on, how much has he hurt their chances?",
  "you beauty!!! He keeps ta king this shoulder-breaking catches in almost every game. This is a top-edge as the batsman looks to hit down the ground and it looks like well clear of mid-off, but the fielder back pedals and somehow gets under it just in time.. Falls backwards hard on that right shoulder. Just saw on the replay.. this is a one-hander.. doubly impressive then",
  "that's a spectacular catch, and what a celebration! Back of length slower ball towards off stump, the batter lofted it down the ground, it didn't go that high but he ran in from long on and threw himself forward to get his fingers under it. Then he gets up, raises his right hand and leg simultaneously, then the left ones for a little jig. All in slow motion",
  "right from the middle of the bat, but he finds deep midwicket. Went down on a knee for the ball outside off, swept it against the angle and holed out, who was a good few yards inside the rope",
  "gets a wicket immediately, the big one! Landed a full delivery on the pads, he launched it high on the leg side with a flick, he was there right at the midwicket boundary at the edge and caught it over his head on the right side. Very well judged",
  "another one falls, another nail hammered by the bowler! The striker pulls this ball, it was a short one, but manages only a top edge down the ground. It's gone high enough for the fielder to run behind the umpire form mid off, he catches it and does a little Calypso jig",
  "threw his bat at this one outside off, get a leading edge and he ran in from deep cover to take the catch",
  "cuts it to point, gone! Delivered this one slower outside off, it went the other way and the batsman went back in the crease to cut it off the middle. He takes a good, low catch towards his left there",
  "edged and gone! This was touch back of length outside off, Smith poked trying to steer it to third man but found a thick outside edge and the keeper pouches it with both hands to his right",
  "can't clear the fielder this time, holes out to long off! He charged down, as usual, chipped the ball down the ground with power, but it didn't have enough to clear long off",
  "mistimes, and gone! He came outside the crease, couldn't take it on the full and lofted it outside off, didn't middle it at all and found sweeper cover",
  "in the arc, but not out of the park even though it looked like he middled it. Fulish around off, lofted between long on and deep midwicket, but it's gone high enough for long on to get under it",
  "you can give them to this guy and he'll gobble them. Pitched up around off, it was slow again, and he looked to loft it over the covers but mistimed it straight down the ground, high in the air. Th fielder comes from long on and catches it safely",
  "makes room for the slower ball on the stumps, it's absolutely full and he slices it straight to short third man",
  "they finally take a catch, the batsman did well to move across, lean forward and flick this full delivery from around off, but straight into the hands of short fine leg",
  "failed to clear long on, seemed as if he had got more than enough on this full one as he sent it climbing into the sky, but it came down in safe hands, and he is not dropping it",
  "wide full toss, the batsman cracks it straight to extra cover, the captain roars",
  "strikes with his magic ball! The umpire's check for a possible no-ball, he is okay. This was shortish, tucking him up for room. He aims to pull, does so half-heartedly, spoons a simple catch to short midwicket, who nearly made a mess of it but recovered and pouched it on the second attempt.",
  "gone, caught behind. He walks off. This was banged in short and on the stumps, he targets deep square with a pull after backing away, but messes it up. Has to settle with a toe-end to end his innings",
  "Strong swing of the bat but he holes out to long-on. Length outside off, he shovel-whips it with plenty of bottom-hand........ caught at head height",
  "Cramp or no cramps, he pulls off a brilliant catch! Length on middle, he backs away a touch and mishits it high in the air. He pedals back from mid-on, then moves to his right, turns back, traces the ball. Dives across to his right, catches and tumbles onto the ground. It's never easy taking these skiers. He initially misjudged it but recovered well",
  "pulls off a sharp catch and sets off on a victory lap. He is mobbed by his team-mates. This was a slower one dug in short and on middle, the striker got a good chunk of wood on the pull. Hits it in the air over midwicket. The fielder covers some ground from deep square leg, dives across to his right and comes out with the ball in his hands",
  "have their man now.. This was dug in short and on the body, he wants to pull it away. But loses all his balance as his bottom hand comes off the bat handle. He has to settle with a top-edge. The man from deep square leg and deep midwicket nearly collided. The fielder somehow plucks it out",
  "a fielder takes it at long-off. He gives this air on off, the man looks for the lofted hit. Does not get enough power behind it. The fielder rushes forward and completes a fine, tumbling catch",
  "Another one! He walks back. This was flighted and full outside off, aims to loft it, ends up slicing it into the hands of long-off",
  "And he is out! He is off on a celebratory run, you can't stop him! This was fuller and flatter on middle, he attempts a reverse sweep first up, gets an under-edge, loops off the pad, rebounds off the back of the bat to the left",
  "Add another super catch to the list! The bowler digs it in very short. The batsman aims for a pull. Hit high up on the sticker of the bat. A man rushes in from deep midwicket",
  "another shortish ball, another shot in the air and he's holed out to wide long-on! It was not a good delivery, but it looked like a trap as he went back to pull, but was caught in the deep. The fielder didn't have to move at all",
  "he has made a blow first up! Serves up one that is full and fast, he wants to smash it over long on but that's too quick. All he can manage is a thick top edge that swirls in the air towards gully. The keeper has plenty of time to move to his right and settle under this. This is going to hurt the lineup even more",
  "makes some good connection on this but clearly it's not enough! he hits the fuller delivery inside out but can only sky it towards deep extra cover.",
  "this is a superb catch! What a wonderful piece of anticipation.. the keeper starts moving towards his left as soon as he sees the batsman shaping for the scoop shot and once the he doesn't make a good connection, he is always in business. It still takes some doing as he has to dive full length to his left to complete this one-handed. Superb effort from him!",
  "such a slow delivery, such a big wicket! This was a slow-slow bouncer, he kept waiting and finally decided to pull, got a top edge as he just checked his shot, and the keeper jumped to his right to take it with both hands over his head",
  "he repeats the shot but has overcooked this shot! This came a bit quicker and that probably messed up with the placement. Even though he made a good connection, he hit it straight to the man stationed at the boundary. A good catch there. A meter here of there and this could have been a six",
  "what a soft dismissal! This was a short and slow delivery on off, he had all the time to whack it anywhere he wanted to, but in his eagerness, he smashes it straight to the man at midwicket. Excellent work.",
  "he takes the big one out! He has perished in the deep. He came down the pitch and wanted to hammer it down the ground, but wasn't to the pitch of it. Once it turned a bit, he was always going to struggle with his timing. It goes high, but not long and is taken easily at long-off",
  "a low full toss brings him a wicket! It was there in the hitting zone... and maybe he would have sent it in the stands.. but all the batsman could do is time it straight to long-on. The fielder is not going to let these go.",
  "bowls another fantastic slower delivery. He was running out of options and he had to throw his bat at that. But ends up slicing it towards wide long-on and is gobbled up by the fielder there",
  "gets a slower delivery, he throws his hands at that, gets a thick outside edge and the fielder flies to his right to pluck it inches off the ground, one-handed. Excellent stuff",
  "he has upper cut this into the hands of the third man! The shot was on - this was a short delivery on off stump - but the lack of pace meant he could not get any distance. The danger man is gone. The bowler gives him a bit of send-off as well",
  "The fielder takes a stunner! The pull shot was on, and he had timed it well too, but he couldn't keep it down. Midwicket is quick to react as he stays low and wraps his finger around the stinger. That shot flew to him in no time",
  "this is a classic dismissal! he wanted to hit it out of the ground, he is not to the pitch of the delivery and so, ends up to-ending it towards long-off where the fielder takes an easy catch",
  "end of a cumbersome innings from the bowler! He throws his bat at this length ball without really getting into a good position. The result: no distance, only height. he takes an easy catch at long off",
  "length ball, he made a good connection but there was absolutely no distance on that... it is swallowed up by the man at deep midwicket easily. The fielder there, who is ecstatic after competing the catch.",
  "and another one departs! He has a swing at a slower delivery and all he can do is edge it to the keeper. There was a faint edge on that one. The bowler turned back to appeal but the umpire had already raised the finger",
  "Another slower one does the job. He swings too early, hits it too high but not long. A fielder runs in from long off and comfortably settles under the skier",
  "he has holed out to long-off. No mistake from the fielder there. He tosses this up, the striker backs away and lofts it to long-off. The fielder runs forward, dives and pouches it",
  "and gone! How soft was that? Good length and outside off, looks like it stuck in the pitch and stopped on. He checks his push, is crease-bound as he spoons it into the hands of mid-off",
  "sets off on a celebratory run with his hands aloft in joy. He loops this up outside off and gets it to move away, the striker is glued to the crease as he aims to drive it over the covers. Only manages an outside edge that is held by the keeper",
  "What's with these leg-slips? This is a sharp, low catch. This was pushed through on a leg-stump line, he glances it. The fielder anticipates well, moves to his left, stoops low and takes it inches from the turf before tumbling onto the ground",
  "A promising innings comes to an end. This was tossed up outside off, he skips out, picks it up from there and drops it to deep midwicket. The fielder comes forward, pouches it and breaks into a customary jig",
  "Fuller and on middle and leg, he sinks to one knee for a slog-sweep. He does not connect well and top-edges it to deep backward square leg, who dives forward and comes out with the ball in his hands and a big smile on his face. In contrast, the non-striker throws his head back",
  "and he finds the fielder. Fractionally short and on middle, aims to help it away with a pull. Mishits it in the air over backward square leg. The fielder runs across to his left from long leg and takes it",
  "a soft dismissal. He backs away outside leg, the bowler follows him with a back-of-the-hand slower ball with some extra bounce. Sliced straight down the throat of backward point. That was the definition of a dolly",
  "nicked off! Back of a length away-going ball outside off. He is crease-bound as he has a slash at it and bottom-edges it to the keeper. The keeper and bowler go up for a caught-behind appeal. Affirmative, says the umpire",
  "gone now! Good delivery, banged in short and seams away outside off with some extra bounce. The batter can't resist himself, he has a waft at it and feeds an edge to the man behind the stumps",
  "This was also shortish, cramping him for room. He looks to work it away after shuffling across and hopping up, instead he loops it in the air. The fielder runs across to his left from short midwicket and takes it at a square-leg region",
  "holes out, this was a length-ball outside off, the batsman clears his front leg, goes for an almighty swipe and hits it into the hands of deep midwicket.",
  "finally a wicket falls and, he holes out to deep backward square leg! He charged down the ground for the ball that was on leg, pulled from the middle of the bat but found the man in the deep",
  "slower ball foxes him to get a wicket! Sent down a short of length offcutter outside off, he threw his bat at it and mistimed it completely to top edge it towards the slips. He came under it to pouch it",
  "straight to short third man for catching practice! The striker opened up, the bowler pitched it full around off and the batsman steered it straight to the fielder",
  "the full and slow delivery is lofted high on the leg side, the man in the cow corner stays calm in the deep and takes it easily",
  "he's got the big wicket, caught at long off! It wasn't a full delivery, was slightly slower, and he mistimed it down the ground, into the safe hands",
  "another top-edge ends in a dismissal! Slower ball on the stumps from the bowler, he swipes it on the leg side with a cross-bat, gets a very high top edge and the fielder has to run in a lot from deep square leg to catch it. Excellent running catch",
  "caught one-handed near his head at point! He has plucked it out of the air! The batsman got down low and scooped a full ball flat and hard towards point, who jumped up with his right hand at head height and caught it cleanly. Apparently, the fielder thought it was going higher than it did and ended up having to adjust, he could have taken it with both hands",
  "he tries to smash it like his partner, getting down low and slogging across the line. The ball hits the top edge though and goes really high in the air, when it lands between square leg and midwicket, it falls into the former's gloves. He called for it early and judged the catch well",
  "a good length ball, on a straight line, he plays a lofted flick but sort of checks his shot, he ends up chipping the ball high in the air and the fielder moving back to get under the batch is mid-off, he takes it easily",
  "slogs the ball hard and flat towards long-on, the fielder rushing to his right to get behind the catch makes it! He takes the catch on the move and the force of the ball sends him toppling to the ground but he hangs on. A superb effort and he is pumped!",
  "It was just short of a length and hurried him up a bit, he mis-timed the loft straight to the fielder at long-on ...",
  "that's a great reflex catch, he's ecstatic after grabbing it with both hands! The striker slapped the ball from outside off straight back to the bowler who had to go low and catch it between his legs",
  "smart catch! The batsman has been bounced out. The bowler has provided it with a short ball that rose above the batsman's chest. The batsman didn't help himself by trying to drag the ball from outside off. The ball heads towards mid-on, who tracks it well and takes it with the reverse cup",
  "that's a spectacular one-handed catch at short fine leg! He went all across his stumps to expose them, got a full delivery outside off and tried to scoop it over short fine leg. But the fielder there took a few steps back and stuck his left hand out over his head to grab it and let out a scream after that",
  "It was the slower ball outside off, the batter was eying the leg side again but only managed a top edge that went high towards the keeper who caught it easily",
  "gets a wicket first ball, a scratchy-looking batsman is gone! He came down the track and made room, swished at it from around off stump and the ball went very high on the off side. Cover and cover point both ran back from their positions and he took it successfully. Wasn't an easy catch",
  "the pressure got to Smith, he's given a catch to third man! It was short and wide outside off, he threw his bat at it and got a top edge high towards third man. The bowler pumps both his fists several times!",
  "he's holed out to long-off, the crowd is ecstatic! It was full and outside off, from back in the crease as the striker lofted it straight down to long off where the fielder didn't have to move much for this catch",
  "the keeper appeals for caught behind, the bowler only turns around and asks a question and the finger goes up! Back of length it is outside off, the batsman swishes and misses. Maybe not, he got an outside edge",
  "yes he tries a yorker and he gets a wicket! It wasn't 100% accurate but made him lose his balance a bit, the striker flicked it high in the air on leg, the fielder there ran to his right and took it comfortably",
  "caught at point! The length was good and the line closer to off stump, he pushed forward and firmly and the ball flew off the outside edge towards the fielder at point, who was standing rather close. Taken well",
  "this is some comeback! He's blowing huge holes in the opposition hull. He moved forward and outside leg to try and make room but ended up being cramped by the good length ball. It bounced a bit more as well. He tried to dab at it awkwardly and only managed to edge it through to the keeper",
  "this is a procession. Meek and embarrassing. He pokes at one from his crease with no footwork and edges it, the keeper stoops low and to his right to catch it. Good length on a tight line outside off from the bowler, nothing extraordinary though",
  "lbw! The bowler slowed his pace and drifted the ball on to leg and middle and got it to turn towards off. He moved his front foot across to sweep but played too early and was hit on the pad. That looked pretty good",
  "pulled away, and he's been caught at deep square leg! He went round the wicket and angled the ball into the stump line, pitching it short of a length. He front foot as he tried to flat-bat a short of a length delivery, the angle from round the wicket denied him the room too. He hit it straight to the fielder",
  "gone! He bowled the ball full and wide outside off stump, not letting the batsman hit to his favoured leg side. He reached out for the ball, got under it and played a lofted drive straight to the fielder on the cover boundary",
  "caught at deep midwicket! He  moves across his crease and chips a length ball off his pads, it lands in the hands of the fielder, who came running in from the boundary to take a simple catch. That has come after considerable punishment. Seemed to play too early",
  "that's a blinder first ball, it was pretty wide outside the off stump, he chased the delivery with a swipe uppishly and the fielder flew to his left from cover point to gab it with both hands. The crowd erupts even more",
  "he's handed it straight to mid-on, gone! The bowler pitched it up, looks like the striker wanted to clear the infield but he merely chipped it to mid on. He didn't have to move much",
  "flighted on leg, the batsman sweeps it hard but can't clear the man. He got a fullish delivery, went down on a knee and swept the ball, but holed out to deep midwicket.",
  "starts with a slower ball and gets his second wicket! The batsman slogged the length delivery to the leg side, mistimed it completely and got a very high edge which the fielder got under by running towards short leg. Took it comfortably",
  "third man's got it! Well, that's at least one outside edge that doesn't sail over the ropes. Good length ball on middle, he goes for the across-the-line hoick. Instead the ball flies to the other side and is taken smartly on the edge of the boundary",
  "holes out to deep midwicket straightaway, he strikes! He sent in a short and flat delivery on the leg stump, went back to pull it from the middle and gave an easy and straightforward catch",
  "The bowler angled in a length delivery and the batsman targeted the leg side, like he always does, and got a top edge that went very high on the off side. THe fielder ran to his right from third man and pouched it to follow it with a jig, the crowd likes it",
  "soft dismissal. Shortish and outside off, the typical ball every batsman wants to run down to third man. Only this time there seems a bit more zip on it and he edges it behind, Cross-seamer it would seem",
  "that's the bouncer and he's got him! He's not been good on the short ball. Not when they're fast and rising above his ribs. The batsman got inside the line to hammer it away past long leg. But only ends up with a feather to the keeper. Big wicket, and the bowler celebrates it as such",
  "too easy! Reward for baiting the batsman with flight. He threw this one up and wide. Duped the batsman into thinking it was overpitched. He wanted extra cover again. But ends up giving a dolly to long-off",
  "well, well, this is quite the eventful start, the batsman gone to an age-old failing, fishes outside off to a back of a length ball, no footwork, nibbles it through to the keeper, the crowd goes wild, cries ring around the ground",
  "Pulls off a smart catch and turns an ordinary ball into a wicket-taking one. It was short, it could have been belted through the off side, but the batter wants to drag it. Finds short midwicket",
  "deep midwicket, here you go, says the batsman. Tossed up outside off, lunges forward and sweeps. But it seems more of a top edge than anything. The fielder barely has anything to do",
  "too quick for him and the fielder has pulled off a stunner running in from long-on! Goes on the pull, but this skids off the deck and gets on him far too early. Gets it on the splice. Two men dived, but one managed not to be distracted and pulls off a brilliant, low catch. Sparks wild celebrations",
  "picks out deep midwicket! Seems a slower ball and he's slogged it down the fielder's throat",
  "standing outside the crease, races down the pitch and miscues the ball straight up. He rushes up, calls for it and takes a skier. And is promptly bear-hugged by Bravo",
  "Johnson strikes early, gets him off the edge at slip! This was not the typical dismissal outside off, he pulled the short ball from around off, got an edge that hit his shoulder and helmet and looped towards first slip where the fielder took a simple catch",
  "the slower ball foxes him! It was short and slightly wide outside off, he pulled the ball early and it went high towards square leg for an easy catch to be taken near the umpire",
  "the big wicket has fallen - he holes out to long on! He came down the track and whipped the ball from leg stump in the air down the ground and the fielder took a good catch while running in",
  "it is difficult to go after this bowler, but the batsman tries swinging this with the incoming angle over long-on, fails to clear the fielder, he takes it some way inside the boundary",
  "edged again, and this time straight to the keeper! This was short and closer to the batsman as he tried to nudge it over the keeper but only handed the fielder a simple catch to his right",
  "big strike, he has mishit to mid off, went after this full delivery, launched it to the left of the man in the position but could not clear him, easy catch",
  "that's a big wicket! THe batsman came down to smash the ball down the ground, he tried and only got a leading edge to send a very high catch for long off",
  "another miscued pull, this time he's gone by giving a simple catch to square leg. But they're checking for the no ball, hang on. Looks like the heel has landed just on the line, don't think there's anything behind it. Third umpire taking his time, trying different angles. From the stump cam near the umpire it seems something was indeed behind the line, maybe. Given out!",
  "can't let the ball go, he just can't! He lofted the low full toss high in the air down the ground and the fielder ran in to complete a very good low catch",
  "picks out deep square leg! After all the effort he'd put into the stroke - ran down the pitch, swung his bat in the big ol arc - but still can't get enough power behind it. Deep square leg actually had to run in several yards to get under it",
  "skewed up in the air and he is comfortably underneath it! It's a quick, full one on middle. He goes for another slog and ends up with a leading edge. But it still flies all the way to deep midwicket. Good, high catch under pressure",
  "length ball, and he finally had time to free his arms. Does so gleefully and ends up caught at deep square leg.",
  "leading edge pops up, he gobbles it up at point. Back of a length delivery on middle, perhaps with a little shape away. Flick goes wrong for him",
  "caught at short third! The reverse sweep fails him this time! This was held back, and tossed up. The striker got down on his knees, twisted his wrists around to swat the ball. Ends up with another top edge that is held quite nicely by him. Ran to his left, dived and got two hands to it",
  "skips down the ground and connects quite well. Except he has thumped it straight down long-off's throat. Runs to his left and slides to pick up a good low catch. Some confusion over it though. He seems to have controlled the ball well, but then flicks it away towards the boundary a couple of seconds after it fell in his hands. But the umpires are happy with it",
  "scoops a catch to cover! Moved away to leg to try and give himself some room, managed to shovel the ball up and has hit it quite hard as well. But he's picked out th fielder. The umpires are checking on if the catch was taken cleanly though. Everything is fine and off he goes",
  "the opening stand is broken, he is caught behind! Angling in from outside off, only pushed at it and outside-edged it to the keeper. Bit of a juggle and he eventually caught it",
  "gets the height, but not the distance this time as he lofts the ball on the off side and he runs in from deep cover to catch that easily",
  "Binny strikes immediately, the batsman has played on, stayed back in the crease to a climbing delivery, tried to dab it with an angled bat, managed a thick inside edge",
  "looked like it would go all the way, but the fielder has taken that out of nowhere at deep square leg, the striker is stunned! Short ball, something bowled often against him these days, and he pulls that with a smack, but the fielder jumps near the boundary rope to his left and falls just inside the line to send him back",
  "faint outside edge and the fielder takes an excellent catch diving forward! The length delivery didn't come in that much. The keeper did very well to get his gloves under it",
  "top edge goes high on the off side, and he runs back from cover to pouch it safely! He swiped the ball to the leg side from outside off, didn't time it at all and the ball gave the man enough time to run back and catch",
  "fullish outside off, goes across and ramps that straight to short fine leg. He went down on a knee for the full delivery, got the middle of the bat but could not clear the fielder in the circle",
  "can't clear him at long off this time! Another poor delivery, this was a full toss outside off, he lofted that high down the off side and it could have cleared the boundary. But he kept his cool at the boundary and took it near his shoulders with his fingers pointing up",
  "that would be embarrassing to both batsman and bowler! He was aiming to run down the track, so the bowler dragged the delivery down, as the batsman was hoping. Nails a pull and then looks around to see a man at square leg with gobbling up the catch",
  "straight up, and he snaps it up at extra cover (or maybe mid-off). Beautifully disguised one against a batsman so dead set on getting his boundaries over the leg side. He doesn't get to the pitch, the ball shoots up off the top edge and the fielder is well in control of a swirler. Academic, really",
  "there's the slog, despite the ball so full and so wide of off stump. Should have looked move over cover instead of long-on. Holes out",
  "glum faces at the dug out as he falls as well. It's the slower short ball outside off, gets the ramp in reply and it lobs gently to short third man",
  "he's miscued that! Lovely, loopy delivery outside off stump enticed the batsman into a slog sweep. But unlike the last ball, he wasn't able to get to the pitch. The ball bounces a bit more than he thought and that's enough to snare the top edge. It still carries to deep midwicket though",
  "captain's come up with another stunner! It was drummed into the covers after he had made room to free his arms. It was a flatter delivery as well. The problem though was he didn't place it far enough from the fielder, who dives low to his right and assures himself of a spot in the highlights of the match later",
  "he's taken it this time! Nothing more than a slog from the batsman, on one knee, and the slowness of the pitch, not to mention the decision not to afford the batsman any pace, means he has miscued it. Easy take for long-on",
  "gets his man this time! Back of a length on middle, not quite short enough for the pull. Unfortunately for him, it stays low too. Misses the ball and is struck quite low in front of all three stumps.",
  "the reverse sweep consumes another man. Slower, length ball on off stump, scooped up only as far as point. He calls for it and takes it diving forward",
  "holes out to deep midwicket! This was a short ball and he didn't time it properly, it went in the air towards the fielder there, who was looking into the sun but caught that comfortably with both hands",
  "and he's back with a wicket! He opens up to heave the ball on the leg side. He doesn't get the distance and the fielder takes a couple of steps back at deep midwicket to catch it. Almost lost his balance",
  "holes out straight to long off! It was full just outside off, he hammered that straight down the ground and the fielder went to his right to catch it safely",
  "good, low catch! The bowler tried the yorker again, hee waving, throats are aching! Short ball angling in and the batsman stayed back to middle that pull straight to deep midwicket. He hardly moves and takes it around his waist. The bowler laughs because he knows it wasn't a great delivery",
  "easily taken at fine leg, that went straight to him! The batsman angled the ball in, it wasn't that quick, and he swiped it high to the leg side, but it didn't go a long way and the fielder hardly moved to catch that one",
  "it's him again, he's got one many more! It was a yorker outside off, the fielder poked at it by opening the face of the bat towards point and edged it behind. The keeper appeals, so does the bowler and the umpire raises his finger. The batters look unhappy, though, because there was no edge and the sound was of the bat hitting the ground",
  "good catch at long-on, running to his left! It was another slower one, on the leg side and hec lofted that very high, trying a six over long on. But he didn't middle that and the fielder got under it nicely to take it with both hands",
  "one more for the team, the fielder caught at deep backward square leg! Slow and short offcutter coming into the batsman, he heaves on the leg side and finds the fielder behind square. The bowler celebrates with a jig",
  "it's all over, he cuts that slower ball from outside off to backward point. There was a bit of room, swung his bat outside off and the fielder took a low catch coming forward to seal the win",
  "Banged in short and hurries on with extra bounce, too quick for this batsman. He hunts for a pull but has to settle with a top edge. The fielder comes in from mid-on, calls for it (midwicket was also in the picture). He holds on",
  "and he picks out the fielder! Back of a length and outside off, slowy in pace. He attempts another flashy cut and miscues it to the man at the covers. He hops up and takes it",
  "he strikes first ball, he has nicked off for a golden duck! Teaser from the bowler - pitched up and nibbling away outside off, the batsman has a wishy-washy poke at it away from the body and offers a dolly catch to the keeper off an outer edge",
  "he holes out. On a length and outside off, hunts for an encore. He does not get hold of it, slicing it straight down the gullet (not literally) of the man at long-off, who makes no mistake here",
  "pulls off a stunner! He takes flight. The bowler has his man now. Its a legal ball. Back of a length and outside off, the batter carves it in the air off the back foot. The fielder flies to his right at backward point and completes a ripper of a catch; one-handed too. He is mobbed by his team-mates. The coach applauds from the dug out",
  "has that been taken! That is a fantastic catch. The batsman drove this away from his body, without any timing. The ball was dying on the cover fielder. He, however, dives forward and takes an excellent catch, claims it straight away. As with all the replays of such catches, this is very hard to tell. He might have taken it cleanly, but this might go against the fielder. It doesn't. Well done, technology.",
  "simply done at mid-on. He moves to his right, eyes on the ball all the way, pouches it and dives with his momentum. No timing on the shot from the bowler even as he runs down the track. Goes for a heave, mistimes it because he is rushed into his stroke",
  "there we have it! Gets down the track and yorks himself. Jams his bat down and gives a dolly back to the bowler",
  "taken! Stunning return catch! Take a bow! This one though didn't get anywhere close to that elevation. Bashes a fuller delivery down the ground with his full force and the bowler, very brave of him, intercepted it!",
  "caught behind! He goes back and cuts hard. This time the ball is not as short and the line is not as wide outside off, so he gets an edge that carries comfortably to the keeper",
  "he's gone now, caught at long-off! He smashed it again, flat and hard. That ball was travelling quickly but the man on the boundary takes it easily.",
  "caught behind! That is a top catch from the fielder, diving across first slip with his right arm outstretched to take the ball. He had pushed forward at a good length ball that pitched around off and shaped away, getting a thick edge. This one was on a much better line.",
  "caught at mid-on, he has got rid of the potential danger man! A tame dismissal that was. He tried to loft a good length ball over the fielder's head at mid-on but could not clear the fielder there",
  "He hasn't gone anywhere in this innings and the stagnation has got to him. He charged the bowler and slogged across the line, the delivery was on a good length and pretty straight, the ball flew straight up in the air and the fielder settled under the skier",
  "caught in the deep! He slogs at one outside off stump and mis-hits it towards wide long-off, about 2/3rds of the way in from the boundary, fielders from deep cover and long off run towards the ball, but the first one has made good ground from the straight boundary and he catches it at head height. He nearly over ran it",
  "the finisher's gone! He bowls a low full toss, the victim can't get under it properly and ends up lofting it flat and straight to the man on the long-on boundary.",
  "that's an important strike and it's a carbon copy of many Gambhir dismissals. Lured into the drive, some away swing foils the stroke, and the outside edge is pouched by the keeper",
  "skews away to long-on and he's taken a good, running catch. The pinch hitter mistimes a back of a length delivery cramping him for room. The batsman has been making room every other ball, this time was no different, but the bowler hiked his pace up and bowled an awkward line on leg and even outside it. Can't swing the arms freely from there",
  "there she blows! Another vicious slog, but it's flat. It can be caught. And it is. Lovely take, he celebrates, and well he should. Flighted it, but made sure it was a shade outside off so that he didn't have room and if he wanted to hit out, like he did, the field was set for it",
  "winds up again, and is caught at long-off. The bowler waves his forefinger around to celebrate. This batsman loves the spinners so he backed himself to clear the field with another slash over the off side. Holes out",
  "straight to long-on! Danced down the track, so he tossed the ball wider outside off. He has to reach out for it and his timing suffers.",
  "down to long-off. Picked him out. Floated outside off and the striker goes for a big hit, all he cared about was the six. Lost his shape, shaves the outside half of the bat, and he's easily held",
  "down the track and lifts the ball down his throat at deep midwicket. Didn't quite reach the pitch, but hoped his power would help make up the difference. Doesn't as the fielder races in a long way from the boundary and takes it so cleanly. Top catch",
  "did not look promising at all as he connected with the slog sweep. Finds the man in the deep. it was a good plan, going with the spin and heaving it away towards the shorter part of the ground. But he hasn't timed it well at all. Seemed to have got under it too much",
  "he has picked the lone man at deep midwicket! It was only marginally short and he probably thought he could clear the ropes, but he doesn't get the timing. The fielder there walks in a few paces and takes an easy catch. A sigh of relief for the bowler",
  "he has picked out the man quite cleanly! THe striker came down the pitch, this time going squarer towards his favourite cow corner area, but he didn't get the distance. The fielder had to sprint to his right to get under it, he takes it easily, then keeps running all the way.",
  "another one at deep midwicket! What are these batsmen upto today! He goes for the slog sweep and times it well. But this one is hit straight to the man at the boundary, who is standing right at the edge, takes an overhead chance easily",
  "superb leaping catch by short fine leg! The batsman had moved across and he was always looking to flick it over the fielder, but doesn't get the timing. It lobs at slow pace, but he still has to time his jump well. He falls backwards after taking the catch",
  "This is a superbly-judged at the edge of the boundary at wide long-on. It was a flighted delivery, the batsman got a lot of bat on it and made good connection in his slog sweep. But the man gobbled it up.",
  "make it two in the over! Now he goes for a slog sweep by moving slightly inside the line, but he doesn't get the distance. This one is easily swallowed at deep midwicket by the fielder. This is the wobble the home team were after",
  "The batsman is beaten by yet another slower delivery and yet again he manages to get height but not the distance. The catcher settles under it at long on and takes it easily",
  "He top edges a pull - the ball might have bounced a bit more than expected - and the fielder comes running in from the deep midwicket boundary to take a well-judged catch. Once he has it safely, he celebrates with a rugby-like kick",
  "caught at short midwicket! Simply chips the length ball off his hips in the air, the fielder moves forward quickly and dives to take the catch",
  "he was timing it so well against the faster bowlers but the batsman has mis-timed this straight to long-on, a soft dismissal really, hit it flat and limply towards the fielder. He dragged it from wide outside off",
  "what a soft dismissal that is! The ball was short and he went on the back foot and simply lofted it so tamely towards long-on, the man came cruising in from the boundary and caught it easily",
  "caught behind! The short ball does it for him. He tried to ramp this short ball over the keeper and got an edge through to the keeper, he almost walks off before the umpire raises the finger",
  "caught behind! The striker goes back to cut and gets a thick edge so that's a sharp catch by the keeper to his right. He followed the ball superbly. Has he done enough?",
  "caught down the leg side! That would have been wide had the batsman let it go but he tries to glance the short of a length ball and the keeper does splendidly to move to his right to catch it. That was so wide outside leg, and he gloved it.",
  "chipped to midwicket for such an easy catch! It was angling in from over the wicket, he looked to flick it in the air on the leg side but mistimed it and lobbed an easy catch for him. No celebration from the bowler",
  "another catch for midwicket, two down! He gave the charge and heaved the fullish delivery, managed an inner edge to the leg side and the man at midwicket only had to jump and catch the ball over his head",
  "holes out to long-off under pressure! He made a lot of room, the man pitched it up and he lofted it straight towards long off where NCN dived forward to get his hands under it nicely",
  "he mistimes the short ball and the fielder takes a good catch running backwards. The batsman made room, pulled the incoming short ball and it went on the off side off the edge, high enough for the point fielder to get under it",
  "and again, he's gone by holing out to long on! Bit of air on off stump, he came down the track and merely lofted the ball straight to the fielder. He hardly had to move",
  "taken this time, stunner from the fielder in the deep! The striker looked to slap the slower one well outside off and got another thick edge, it was ready to sail over short third man, but he flies to his left and grabs that with both hands. The fielder is thrilled, the team celebrates but not much reaction from the supper staff in the dug out. The coach is not animated at all",
  "slower offcutter on length on the off side, he takes a step down and holes out to long on. He didn't pick the slower one, it seems, and lofted it straight down his throat in the deep",
  "leading edge caught at deep cover nicely! Length delivery around the off stump, he tried another heave on the leg side and only got a thick and high leading edge. He had enough time to get under it in the deep",
  "slams it down the ground in the air, it would have easily gone for four but the fielder runs to his left and goes low in front to get his hands under it in no time. Excellent catch and the striker departs",
  "that's not from the top edge, he has simply lofted the length ball down the ground to long on for an easy peasy catch",
  "goes down on a knee to slog it on the leg side, gets another edge as the ball zips, and this one doesn't go far. The fielder runs towards the short cover region and takes it easily",
  "holes out to mid-on! The bowler had given this more air outside off, the batter attempts a swipe over the leg side, he can only drag it to mid-on off the inner part of the bat. The fielder comes in, dives forward to snap it up",
  "and he picks out mid-off! The bowler follows up a with a length-delivery outside off, he camps back, seeks to drive and ends up chipping it to mid-off. The fielder helps himself to a simple catch. He takes a high-five from his captain",
  "the effort comes to an end, sharp catch from the fielder. This was banged in short, climbs on a middle-stump line. He attempts a pull and can only top-edge it. Long leg dives forward and takes a smart tumbling catch",
  "Full in length on middle, he backs away and toe-ends the attempted slap to the covers, where the fielder reverse cups his hands around it. No mistake. This did not need a jump. The striker throws his head back.",
  "he holes out! Smart, low catch. Nicely tossed up and outside off, this one also holds up in the pitch. The striker looks to drive but is timing is foiled as he feebly chips it to cover, where the fielder dives forward and snaffles it.",
  "holed out to long-on! Full outside off, he miscues the lofted strike and finds the fielder, who helps himself to an overhead catch. His innings has been cut short",
  "The home crowd loving this. This was on a back of a length and moving across off with some extra lift, he has a lazy waft and nicks it off to the keeper off an outer edge. The batman had yanked his bottom hand off the bat while playing at it. Crucial strike.",
  "the fielder pulls off a sharp, low catch, one-hander! The striker has to depart. Fullish and outside off, he drives it in the air. A fielder runs in from mid-off, dives forward and plucks it out with his right hand. Thought it would have popped out, but he managed to hang on to it.. went with both hands, it got stuck in the right hand",
  "the fielder reverse-cups his hands around it. This was a slower, short ball outside off. Offcutter with extra bounce. He is undone by the change-up, wanted to go hard on it but ends up chipping it to cover",
  "On a length and outside off, he wants to turn this over the leg side, gets a leading edge and spoons a simple catch to backward point.",
  "pouched it! The bowler strikes with his favourite ball. He shuffles across off, the bowler follows him with a full ball, he seeks to paddle it away but does not get hold of it. Toe ends it, the fielder moves back and steadies under it",
  "taken at the edge of the boundary! Flatter and on a shortish length on off as he advances down the track and swipes it. The fielder judges it well and completes a good overhead catch just before the deep midwicket boundary. He took a step or two back but held his balance, ensuring that the momentum did not take him beyond the ad boards.",
  "Top, low catch from the fielder as he batsman holes out. He dives to his left at deep square leg and throws the ball into the air. Length on middle, Morgan invests in a pick-up spot and connects well but has to go",
  "soft dismissal. Soft end to his knock. He has to drag himself off the field. This was a low full toss on a fourth-stump line, chipped into the hands of midwicket off the toe end for a dolly. The bowler has a smile on his face",
  "End of a sketchy little knock. He flits around in the crease, shuffles across off. The bowler pushes it fuller and outside off, scooped into the hands of mid-off, takes it in front of his chin. Soft as wax.",
  "and he picks out short cover! Pushed through on middle, he comes down the track and chips it straight down the throat of the fielder. The batsman shakes his head as he trudges back",
  "The bowler is in th striker's ears! Banged in shortish and hurries on outside off, he wants to slog it away, only manages a thick top-edge. Good, overhead catch at mid-off",
  "holes out! Fuller length and around off, stops on the pitch. Change-up. He steps away a bit and mishits it high in the air. He runs in from long-off and snaffles the take before tumbling onto the ground",
  "and this time the ball finds the fielder at long leg. Fractionally short on middle, he picks it up from there and plays it straight to the fielder. He could have placed that better... There it is, the early wicket",
  "makes no mistake now! Gone. Pushed through and spins in, he goes low for a slog sweep, does not get hold of it. Mishits it to deep midwicket",
  "Fuller on a leg-stump line, he backs away, comes down and goes for a big hit. Only slices it off the bottom of the bat to long-off",
  "starts with a full ball outside off, and his innings comes to an end with a massive swipe. Doesn't connect cleanly this time, and skies it high to mid-on",
  "slower ball outside off, and he doesn't get hold of the attempted loft over long-off, ends up chipping it straight into the fielder's hands",
  "and he's gone! That was another crisply hit pull, but it was in the air and he picked out the man at deep midwicket",
  "another wide and full ball. He tries to make room and hit over cover, only manages a thick edge that the keeper takes well. Makes it look simple, but good footwork to move quickly to his right",
  "bouncer and he's taken out! It was a well-directed ball, over the left shoulder. Not an easy place to pull from, and he only got a thin edge through to the keeper",
  "gone! it's fired flat towards leg stump and he went for the sweep, looking to hit over short fine leg, but simply didn't middle it and popped a simple catch to the fielder, off the top-edge",
  "very full on middle stump, and he tried to play a straight-bat, bottom-hand shovel to get under the ball and get elevation. He managed this, but not the distance, and the skier dropped gently into long-on's hands",
  "again it's flat and quick, but it's shorter, and angled into the batsman's body to cramp him for room. Goes for the pull, gets it high on the bat, and holes out to long-on",
  "another slower ball on off stump. He makes room to hit over cover, ends up slicing it high in the air, straight to third man",
  "and that's a typical end to a typical T20 innings. Runs down the track again but fails to reach the pitch. May have wanted to hit straight down the ground, ends up flicking it uppishly, straight down the throat of deep midwicket",
  "excellent riposte, this. The batter makes room this time and teh bowler bangs it in, gets a lot of bounce. He wasn't in a great position to uppercut that, and ended up scooping it feebly into short third man's hands",
  "sees him skip down the track and bowls it slower and wider. He goes through with the shot but ends up slicing it high and not quite getting the distance, finds the man at wide long-off",
  "juggle, juggle, gone. This must have been a plan, judging by how often the bowler has been angling these darts in towards leg stump. Too quick for the batsman to get down on his knee and sweep, and he ends up lapping uppishly from a semi-crouched position, and hits it straight to short fine leg, at chest height. He didn't catch it cleanly on first attempt, but managed to grab onto it",
  "short ball, dug in sharply, and it's too close to him to pull with any authority, and it balloons in the air, straight into the hands of the man running in from deep midwicket",
  "slower ball wide outside off and he's gone! It was just short of driving length, and the low arm caused it to angle away from the batsman a bit. Went for the big hit, on one knee, looking to go over long-on, and ended up edging it to the keeper",
  "that's his favourite pick-up shot, that's effortlessly timed, and that's hit straight into deep midwicket's hands! It was full on the pads, and he flicked it with an almost casual air. Shot was on, I suppose. He may have been looking to hit it a lot squarer than he ended up doing.",
  "and he strikes! It's a slower short ball on off stump. The striker goes for the pull, top-edges it, and the ball balloons into th fielder's throat (figuratively, of course).",
  "nailed it to deep midwicket! Same ploy, whisking that front leg aside and smearing the short ball hard and flat. But he picks out the fielder, who takes a pressure catch",
  "Lobs up a slower ball, which brings out the classic golf swing. But he mistimes it, carries only as far as long-on. The catcher sets off on a celebration, pumped up as ever",
  "leg-stump full toss has been whipped to deep square leg! Silly cricket galore, and what can you expect in a shoot out format?",
  "this is normal pace, this is short, and he has picked out mid-on. Wanted to smash it far longer as he rocked back for the pull, but his intention to hit the ball a bit too hard has hurt his timing. Comes off the bottom of the bat. Wry grin as he walks back, knew he should have belted that",
  "and there is proof that bats these days have an edge. He gets it as he bowls the ball wide, trying to evade his reach. The slash over the covers doesn't come out as well as he'd hope, but he has to go",
  "that's the short ball, to trump the batsman rushing down the pitch. Gets a top edge that is pouched at long-off.",
  "steps towards the leg side to make a bit of room and the bowler spots that and bowls it slow, loopy and wide outside off. The striker reaches out to try and hit it over the off side, doesn't hit it cleanly - it zipped away a fair amount too - and ended up spooning a simple, loopy catch to cover",
  "and he strikes! It was a good length ball angling away, and he pokes at it hesitantly, with his feet moving after his hands went at the ball, and he dives low to his right to pouch the edge",
  "gone! That was full and wide and he goes after it hard, throws his hands at the ball and ends up slicing it high in the air, straight to third man",
  "flat, a touch short, and he rocks back to pull, gets a lot of power on it but hits it in the air, and the fielder runs to his left from deep midwicket to complete an excellent catch, diving low to his left and taking it with both hands",
  "slower ball angled away, and it gets his wicket. Slashes away from his body and only manages a top edge that loops to the right of the keeper, who settles himself under it and completes a simple catch",
  "gone! That's the perfect delivery, angling away into the corridor, the length leaves his feet rooted to the crease, and he pokes at it with an angled bat and edges to the keeper. A hint of shape away as well",
  "that's an absolute shocker! A dumbfounded striker is looking at the umpire for a no-ball. But this should be out. A full toss has been flicked straight at short fine leg. Doesn't look like he'll be saved. He will be kicking himself all the way back to the pavilion",
  "saw the length ball, thought it was there to be heaved away over leg again. But he's into the shot too early. Gets a leading edge and the catch balloons to point. Cross-seamer works for the bowler, cross-bat doesn't for his nemesis.",
  "full on middle, he stays deep in his crease and looks for a heave seeking to clear the boundary. But he hasn't got as much as he'd like. Long-on runs to his right and takes a clean catch",
  "fuller delivery outside off, goes for a booming drive through the off side. All he gets is an outside edge through to the keeper.",
  "short ball, came quickly onto the body, as the batter was forced into an awkward position, he still plays the pull, top edges it and that loops to backward square leg, massive wicket this",
  "holes out to mid-off, looking to clear the man in the ring but he doesn't get enough power on that as it hits high on the bat, the ball gently flies towards the catcher, he doesn't drop that",
  "straight to cover! Seems the slower ball has worked out. It was a length ball, on leg stump. He had made room for the slash and picks out the fielder",
  "that's an outside edge, and it's travelled as far as long-off. It was fuller on middle, he clears the front leg and looks to thump it towards long-on again only to mis-hit it. Big strike for Royals",
  "that's an absolute corker! It's back of a length, it straightens away off the seam, he has to play. He does so with a nervy push. Shaves the outside edge and carries through to the keeper. Bounce, pace, movement. The good old triple threat",
  "right down the throat of long-off. It was a length ball on and around off stump, the batsman makes room to hammer it over the fielder, but isn't able to.",
  "that's a stunner at long-on! This had gone miles in the air, he had a lot of time to contemplate how the match would change depending on this catch. Runs to his right, judges it wonderfully well. And eventually he pouches it very safely. Goes for a length ball outside off but the slog doesn't come off",
  "fuller delivery outside off, sliced away but only as far as point. Simple catch, simply taken",
  "good length ball, he goes for a swing and he gets it pretty high on the bat. He runs in from long-on and takes a simple catch.",
  "short, wide, slapped, caught. It was a terrible delivery, deserved to be punished, smashed to smithereens, but he stood up, smacked it hard, and found backward point, hitting it to him at a comfortable height, and he took it just over his head",
  "tossed up outside off, and that's an excellent catch. He looks to hit down the ground, maybe over mid-on, and ends up slicing it over cover. He pouches it while running away from the batsman, towards the boundary, and does very well to keep his eye on it and make it look simple. He celebrates (if we can call it that) by flinging the ball angrily into the turf",
  "tossed up a bit more, outside off, and he goes for another big hit. Hits it okay enough but not right out of the screws, and ends up offering long-off the simplest of catches",
  "short and wide, and for the umpteenth time that's become a wicket-taking delivery. He stands there and throws his bat at it, and only manages to top-edge to the keeper",
  "two fielders converge at long-off, one takes it. Length and outside off, slower in pace. The striker is hoodwinked. His bat twists in his hand as he chips it to the fielder",
  "he pulls off the finger-on-the lips celebration. No tape-on-the-mouth act here. This was fuller and outside off, change-up. He reaches out and slices it in the air. He pedals back from backward point, loses his balance; manages to hang onto the catch even as short third man was converging. Oh wait, has the bowler overstepped? This is close.. Does he have some particle of his heel behind the crease? Given Out, he may have got some part of it behind the line.",
  "Pushed through outside off, he backs away and attempts a cut only to slice it straight down the throat of the man at point",
  "the crowd is pumped because the bowler has struck! Short ball outside off, he looks to cut it on the off side, the ball has good bounce and gets an upper edge before it's taken safely by the fielder around his shoulders",
  "holes out to long-on, falls under pressure! He also came down the track but the ball came even later to him, he lofted on the leg side and long on came in easily to catch it",
  "struck hard but straight to mid-off! Pitched up outside off, he drilled it back uppishly and is taken for a straight and quick catch",
  "in the air again, taken very well this time at deep point! The bowler gave room, the batter swung his arms and played it uppishly as the fielder ran in to get his hands under the ball with a forward dive. Excellent catch",
  "tries another one and holes out to deep midwicket! Length delivery on the leg stump, he slogged on the leg side and didn't send it too far as the man ran in from the deep to take it safely",
  "it's high, it's taken! The batsman swivels his bat for the slower delivery which goes in the air towards deep square leg. In an age where fielders can take the toughest catches, he takes these simple ones too",
  "slower delivery on the stumps, he makes room and slogs it down the ground to hole out to long-on. That's the breakthrough",
  "superb catch running in from deep cover! The striker got some room to free his arms outside off, swung his bat and the fielder ran in hard to bend low to his toes to catch that nicely",
  "doesn't get the middle of the bat and finds deep midwicket! He came down the track, but there was hardly any pace on the ball and he slogged it down the fielder's throat",
  "that's gone too high on the leg side but a fielder comes in from there and takes it safely! The batsman swung his bat for the back of length delivery that was going towards middle stump, he might have middled that but it went way too high",
  "the slower ball works again. He slogged it high on the leg side and the batsman made sure he got his hands and body under it at long on to take it safely",
  "top edge this time that goes very high and he comes in from long-off to take that safely! Finally the slower one works as the batter slogs from outside off, sends it high but is caught this time",
  "holes out to long-off. Back of a length and outside off, skewed to short extra cover for a simple catch. The bottom hand came off the bat, foiling the timing timing",
  "he has nicked off! The keeper and bowler go up straightaway.. The forefinger goes up slowly. This was on a good length and angling away outside off, the striker chases it and can only edge it to the keeper, who moves to his right and snaps it up. The skipper is pumped, super-pumped..",
  "and the magic ball strikes! The short ball works. This was banged in and climbs alarmingly on the stumps, he perhaps was caught in two minds whether to play at it or sway his upper body out of the way. He can't get out of the tangle and ends up faint-edging it to the keeper",
  "hw takes it at sweeper cover! The batsman has to depart. Pitched up, outside off and cuts away, he nips down the track, but does not connect well with the lofted strike. Slices it into the hands of the fielder there for a dolly. He reverse-cups his hands around it",
  "caught behind! Simple catch for the keeper. On a length and zipping through outside off with some extra pace. The bowler perhaps looked for the cut with his feet paralysed to the crease, only feeds an outside edge to the keeper, who throws the ball up in the air and celebrates",
  "gone now, he perishes to scoreboard pressure. They continue to fade away. Flat around off, he sinks to one knee, goes for a slog sweep and top-edges it to deep midwicket",
  "he claims a catch, appeals. He is celebrating.. They go to the TV umpire. Legal ball. This was a low full toss, Binny gone for a golden duck. This was on a back of a length, he skips out and misses the flick, the ball dribbles towards backward point. He rushes off in pursuit of a quick single. But is sent back. Its all too late and he is caught short. Good work from the bowler",
  "picks out mid-off. Full and on middle, he backs away and slices it straight down the throat of the fielder",
  "another nail rammed in the coffin. He bangs it short and outside off, the batsman is in no position to pull, mis-times it, hit high on the bat for a simple catch at deep midwicket",
  "he strikes. He short-arm pulls and finds the fielder. This was dropped short on middle and leg, the batter brings out his pet shot but hits is straight down the throat of deep square leg. He was cramped for room there",
  "Massive blow! Tossed up, outside off, he attempts a lofted strike after dancing down the track, does not connect properly, slicing it to long-off. The fielder reverse-cups his hands around it. The skipper is off on a celebratory sprint. The bowler is pumped too",
  "Crucial wicket! Short ball directed on a leg-stump line, tucks him up for room and messes with the attempted pull. He loops it to short fine leg off a top edge, the fielder there takes a couple of steps back and snaps it up..",
  "the crowd has been hushed into silence. The batsman nicks off to the keeper, who makes no mistake now. Good length and outside off, he hunts for a powerful drive over the covers and feeds an outer edge to the man behind the stumps",
  "he strikes, he gets rid of his man! This was an innocuous ball on the hips, he picks it up and flicks it straight to short fine leg, who bends forward and pouches it",
  "and the fielder pulls off a brilliant catch! Around off with some extra bounce, he sinks to one knee and goes for a sweep. He mis-hits it in the air, the batsman sprints in from deep backward square leg, dives forward and takes a superb, low catch! ",
  "holes out to long-on. Low full toss on middle, instead of launching it over long-on, he scoops it straight into the hands of mid-on, caught near chest height.. The bat twisted in his hand, foiling his timing. The coach winces in the dug out.",
  "snaffled at long-on! Back of a length and on middle, skiddy ball. He goes for a lofted strike and mis-hits it to the man there, who comes in and completes a simple catch",
  "he perishes off the penultimate ball of the innings. The man slips in another slower ball outside off, he backs away for a cut. Ends up slicing it into the hands of point",
  "slower ball. Looked like he picked it but didn't time the shot well. It was on a length, the slower one, and he set himself up for the big slog. In the end he got cramped a little, and ended up hitting this straight to long-on.",
  "wide half-volley, the bowler gets away with it. He hits this off the toe end as he looks to go over cover. The mis-hit settles at deep cover. A dot and a big wicket",
  "wide of the crease again, a full toss to cramp him up. He is cramped on the shot as he looks to go over midwicket. The fielder charges in from the fence, and dives forward to take an excellent catch.",
  "wide full ball, the batter sees some release, he drives it hard, goes uppishly to cover-point where he seems to have taken a low catch but immediately says he is not sure. The soft signal as they go upstairs is not out. It looks like it has bounced, but it has bounced in his fingers that have kept the ball from touching the ground. Finally given out officially",
  "short of a length, angling away, he looks for a big hit, gets a thick edge and third man takes the catch",
  "he is down the wicket to drive at this wide and full ball, and can't clear extra cover. Another wicket falls.",
  "slower ball again. This is short of a length, on the pads, gets the leading edge, and lobs for an easy catch to point",
  "another wicket goes down. Looks for a big hit, gets too under a length ball and is caught at wide long-on",
  "Welcome back! He is celebrating again. He got a big wicket for Sydney Thunder in the BBL final not long ago, and he has got the big one. the striker, who had nine lives, doesn't get another. The slower offcutter has been driven straight down the lap of mid-on.",
  "Those celebrations are back, arms aloft! Slower bouncer, the batsman shapes up to pull, but the ball hasn't arrived. He then looks to steer it, but is late on the attempt and the extra bounce takes the edge through to the keeper.",
  "there's a party in the infield and the batsman are only too happy to wander in and be suckerpunched. A length ball outside off sticks in the pitch a bit and robs the batter of a pretty drive on the up. Shouldn't be playing those shots here.",
  "looks at the heavens and wonders why me? It was a short ball, but with the bowler putting in so much effort to dig it into the pitch, it sticks in it and doesn't come on. He whacks it hard, but he cannot time it well. The ball slows up as it comes to him and he can only bunt it straight to the man at cover.",
  "that almost seemed like it ran off the face! the batsman was on leg stump, and he was willing the ball to take enough of the bat to run away to third man. The ball, pesky thing, doesn't listen. Bet its going to get grounded."
