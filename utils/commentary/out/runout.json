  "this is good running! No, no.. this is surprising for everyone on the field as the throw from the deep as hit the non-striker's end direct. Cover wasn't even keen on taking the throw.. He thought the fielder had been slow but the fielder from deep extra cover, makes up for it with an accurate hit. The batsman was well short of the crease there. No need to check with the third umpire. ",
  "another rising delivery, the batsman gets on top of it and drops it towards backward square leg. He tries to sneak  a second one as the fielder is placed deep, but the throw comes in and finds the batsman short of the crease.",
  "Very poor running here. The striker dabbed the full delivery to cover point and called for a single, but the non-striker was slow to respond to a late call. He was well short when the throw from point came to the keeper. More of the striker's mistake actually, because his partner was responding to his call..",
  "direct hit from extra cover claims him, he drilled this full delivery straight to the fielder and went for the single, replays show he is inches short",
  "fullish and curling in again as the batsman swings across the line. There's a big leg before appeal and the batsman has absently wandered down the pitch. The fielder swoops down on the ball from short cover and races over to the keeper's end and flicks the bails off. Terrific presence of mind from the captain",
  "This would have been a catch, but now it might well be a run-out. It was a jaggy delivery and he was looking to force it down the ground. But the punch had no power in it. The fielder dives to his right and gets the very tip of his fingers on it and luckily, it strikes the stumps",
  "fired this full on the stumps and the batsman drilled it down the pitch, the batsman had set off and had to quickly turn around, the fielder back flicked it to the stumps and he was short, there was barely an appeal and nor did the umpire raise the finger, the batsman didn't wait and walk off, for a second we didn't know what was going on!",
  "That looked really tight from a certain distance, so the umpire has called for the big screen's help. The frame shows the batsman marginally out of this line, full credit to the fielder backing up at the right time to exact a dismissal.",
  "trouble here, there is a direct hit, superb work from the man at backward point, the batsman had walked too far down the pitch after getting hit on the thigh pad with an incoming ball, the fielder swooped on the ball and found him well short",
  "fuller, quicker, wants the leg-bye to point, but there is no run here. The runner has given up, and this time the throw doesn't miss",
  "poor from the batsman. The bowler bowls a wayward bouncer, but he is not looking at his partner who has rushed up for the bye that gives him the strike. Low alertness and slow running have cost them here. Good presence of mind from the keeper, lobbing the throw to the bowler",
  "reaps reward for alertness. This was fired down leg, the batsman can't lay bat onto it. The ball clips his boot on its way to the keeper, who moves to his left and collects the ball. Having realised that the striker had strayed out of the crease in search of a quick single, he lasers a throw and hits the stumps and that too with the gloves on. What was the batter doing there?",
  "Another direct hit from the keeper, the non-striker is in trouble, he has to go. He is caught short. OUT flashes on the big screen. This was marginally back of a length and on middle, tucking him up for room, the batsman stays back and chops it to the keeper. He moves to his left and is quick onto the ball and fires another direct hit, this one an under-arm throw",
  "Oh well, he is in trouble, gone by a long way. Dibbly-dobbler on off, the striker waits on it before before chopping it down to short third. He takes off for a single, his partner is late to respond. He is not the best of runners between the wickets either. A man in the deep Nails a direct hit to signal the doom. Fine, flat throw",
  "and he walks off. Sharp work from the man at point, he had only one stump to aim at it and he lasers a direct hit. Back of a length and outside off as the striker takes a step out and punches it to point. He drifts off for a single, but is sent back. He pulls off a desperate dive, it ends in vain. Point moved to his right, dived and grabbed the ball even as it swerved away. He lost his balance but managed to hit the bullseye. Aiming like a boss...",
  "takes an aim at the stumps, hits and catches him short. His partner is back on strike, though. Yorker, which is squirted back to the bowler. The non-striker sets off, and the striker scarifies himself for the cause. Lightning throw from extra cover",
  "so much is happening here, and there is run out at the end of it! He pushed the slower ball back to the bowler, who got a hand to it and the ball deflected towards cover. The striker is more than halfway down the pitch but the over fielder has done a Jhonty Rhodes - he doesn't move - and he gets an underarm direct hit at keeper's end by the time the striker dives back",
  "quick short ball on the leg side, it's not a wide, and square leg gets the ball from the keeper to hit the stumps this time. We have a run out!",
  "run out chance, gone to the third umpire! Worked the ball towards sweeper cover in the deep, they had no choice but to go for two. But he fell couple of inches short with that accurate throw",
  "meaty blow, superb fielding in the deep from and the batsman is run out, would you believe it! He middled it for the cow corner boundary, where the fielder fell over the boundary while taking the catch but made sure he threw the ball back in just before that. The batsmen settled for one initially and realised a little late there was time for a second. The batsman  is not completely fit and is slow to come back for the second. Accurate throw and he's well short, what a faux pas",
  "has he been run-out? This was slid through on the stumps, punched down the track. the fielder follows the ball, dives and deflects it back onto the non-striker's end all in one motion. During the process, he had also collided with the striker, who was thrown off balance and lost his bat and landed on his glove. Looks like the bails came off the groove before he landed on his right glove and made his ground. The TV umpire examines it from various angles and gives it OUT! Unfortunate state of affairs here. Full marks to the fielder, though, for the presence of mind",
  "Sharp work from the man at backward point. He nails the stumps at the striker's. The bowler nips this one back into the batsman after going wide of the crease, who does not meet with the flick, the ball wanders away behind point. The pair want to sneak in a leg bye. He moves quickly to his left, collects the ball and flings an accurate throw at the bull's eye. The victim is well short",
  "wide yorker, with the batsman making room. Great option from the bowler and the batsmen wanting to sneak a bye hurts them. The non-striker is late to respond and is beaten by the throw from the keeper back to the bowler, and then the bowler racing back to knock the stumps over",
  "run out on the last ball as he drives the last ball straight to cover, the fielder throws the ball to the bowler and there's no way the batsman can get there",
  "dropped at long-on! Th batsman waited for the slower ball and lofted it down the ground, where the fielder had enough time to take a few steps in but he spills it. At least he throws it quickly and the batsman can't come back in time",
  "full and wide, flat-batted to long-off. The batsman ran back, his partner sent him back, and he had no chance of turning back and making his ground as the fielder, fired in a low, flat throw to the stumps",
  "fullish outside off, checked drive to mid-off. They go for the single, and the thrower goes for the keeper's end and hits the stumps direct. The fielding team is already celebrating, but it's gone to the third umpire. You can see why. The batsman is stretching but he's well short of the crease. Sharp thinking, and a brilliant flat throw. The victim started running a touch too late, and was watching the fielder as he ran.",
  "short outside off, and that's a convoluted way for a bad ball to get a wicket. It stopped on the pitch a bit, and the striker, shaping to cut, ended up flat-batting it back to the bowler, who fielded it and turned around in a flash to flick the ball at the stumps, too quick for him, who struggled to return to his crease.",
  "yorker now, on middle and leg. LBW appeal from the bowler, but it isn't given. It's leg byes, ricochets to the keeper, who runs to the stumps and runs him out. On replay, that lbw shout looked plumb in front of middle stump.",
  "slower ball outside off, and he's gone for a needless wander, and the fielder has run him out. The batsman went for the big slog, missed, and took a few steps down the pitch, looking for the bye. His partner wasn't interested. The fielder spotted it quickly and threw at the stumps and hit them direct, and his run has come to an end.",
  "run out chance, it's the keeper's smart work again despite a wide throw, the decision goes upstairs! Replays show out despite the dive, out by a couple of inches. The batsman punched at the ball towards sweeper cover, initially they might have thought of two and he turned around quickly, so did his partner but said no after a couple of steps. The throw at keeper's end was wide, the keeper came out of the crease and parried the ball to the stumps",
  "full toss gets a wicket, it's a run out, so what? he slashed at the high full toss that was well outside off, sweeper cover came around as the batsmen looked for the second. It was a pretty flat throw, the man backing up went to his right a bit, collected and threw the ball to the stumps, like Dhoni, to send the batsman back",
  "A run-out chance and they go upstairs. He dives across to his right and deflects the ball onto the non-striker's end. His bat is in the air. He has to depart after drifting out of his crease and backing up. This was darted flatter and on middle, the batter drills it ram-rod straight. The bowler manages to tip it onto the stumps. Raina's bat was in the air when the bails came off the groove",
  "caught miles short! Everything coming together now. This was another slower ball outside off, pushed to backward point, he collects the ball but fails to effect a direct hit. The back-up fielder fails to gather the ball, but long-on runs in and fires a direct hit at the bowler's end",
  "that's a bizarre run out, gone! He flicked the ball from middle to deep midwicket and for some reason they thought of taking the second run. Accurate throw and he's run out by a mile.",
  "that's such a bizarre run out! The striker pushed the straight full toss back towards the bowler but hit his partner, then the ball hit the umpire and went to the left of the bowler. Both thought there was a run there and took off, but by the time they turned around, the fielder had picked the ball up from wide of the crease and hit the stumps even though he would have seen only one from that angle!",
  "what a strike by, he's run the batsman out! The striker pulled but was beaten by another slower ball, tried to get off strike by stealing a bye but the keeper was too sharp for him. He collected cleanly and threw quickly, the direct hit catching the sprinting batsman inches short.",
  "THe fielder doesn't realise that the batsmen are confused and throws the ball late, which makes the non-striker come back for the second. But his throw is accurate and the bowler takes the bails off casually, catching the bat short despite the dive",
  "this has been a great little mini-battle. The batsman looks to get a leg up by racing down the pitch, but the bowler pulled his length back and this pitch helps him out with some zip and bounce. The batsman follows it with his hands and gets an outside edge. Wants a single to escape the stranglehold and that's ended up a mistake as well. He is well short. The direct throw from short third man effects a run out",
  "short ball on middle, he pulls to deep square leg. But his partner wants two! Oh dear, this could be bad! It is! The batsman says no from the non-strikers' end rightly perhaps, by which time he had been halfway down. Ran the first too slow, while his partner was motoring. Has to turn, does his best, stretches as much as he could, but the throw has beaten him.",
  "what a waste of a wicket, it was worked in front of square, there was only one in it as deep midwicket came in, they wanted a second, he started and stopped, his partner had come a long way out before he turned back, the throw was accurate on the bounce to the keeper, and he is comfortably short",
  "they've gone for a greedy bye off a wide and it seems to be quite close. And he's gone. It was a slower ball that skirted well past and he is completely fooled. Goes for a swipe and is hit on the body. They call through for the run, but a fielder rushes forward, grabs the ball, turns around and nails the throw at the other end. The victim is well short",
  "yorker on the toes, flicked to deep square leg. The batsman scurries for a second run, but he can't beat the incoming throw",
  "is he gone? Yep, he's walking off! It was slid well wide of him, and the ball kept low as well. Manages a cut towards point. Then the indecision hits. The striker calls, and then worries about point. By that time bth had charged down. Then comes the fumble from the fielder and he thinks he can make it, but the man at point recovers quickly and gets the throw to the right end and the fielder backing up breaks the stumps",
  "he's gone! It certainly appears so. He has beaten the batsman in flight - who was rushing down the track, but he realises the ball has been held back. All he can do is bunt it into the off side and then he gets greedy. Wants a single, but his partner says no. Amid the indecision, th bowler has rushed across and slung a throw to the keeper, who does the rest",
  "misses the full delivery outside off, he tries to sneak in a bye but the keeper, who had his right glove off, gets a direct hit",
  "but there's a run out and he is going back! The batsman flicked the length ball to midwicket and called for a very risky single, he responded too but the flat throw was pretty accurate and the keeper whipped the bails off in no time",
  "such excellent work from the bowler, the batsman is run out! He blocked the yorker back to the bowler and was well out of the crease. He didn't go back immediately even though the bowler stopped it with his right hand, he threw the ball back in no time, rattled the stumps and the slide back wasn't enough",
  "goes back to a good length ball, it's another slider, helps it off the inside edge to deep midwicket. Two is on, but the batsman is quite slow to turn. That could well cost him. But wait. it appears like the keeper's gloves have kissed the bails loose before he brings the ball over to knock on the stumps. It's terribly close. The third umpire's looking at a lot of replays, but the ball was in his gloves when his webbing tips one of the bails over. And the big red letters tell him to go home",
  "nails the yorker on off stump, he squeezes it out to deep cover and comes back for a second run, hoping the throw will be bad. It isn't",
  "this innings ends with a run-out as he can't put a bat on this length ball, he takes off for a bye, but the keeper hits the stumps to end the partnership",
  "looked to punch this through off but gets a thick outside edge, that one flew past slip. He might have got a hand to that, he actually did. The two take off for a single, but hello hello, he fires in a throw and catches him short at the striker's end. Initially there wasn't much interest, but the replays show he is well out. What a bonus!",
  "run out by a direct hit! The match is swinging. He played the ball to extra cover and ran, the fielder swooped on the ball, picked up and nailed the throw, catching the victim at least a foot and a half short",
  "it's all happening here! The bowler bowls it in the blockhole outside leg to counter the foot movement outside leg stump. He inside edges the ball on to the pad and the ball rolls towards the bowler. The non-striker charges for the single but his partner sends him back. The bowler rushes to the ball, picks up, and hits the stumps with the victim well short",
  "banged in short and outside off, he jumps up, punches it to the covers and sets off. The fielder moves to his left swoops down on the ball and puts in an accurate throw to the man backing up, who whips the bails off. The bat got jammed into the ground and he was caught short! The skipper is pumped, super-pumped",
  "he has been run out, a fielder nails the stumps down in haste. He fails to connect with the attempted reverse-ramp again, the bowler wants a single but is sent back. The ball rolls off the pad to the leg side, he runs forward, collects, turns back and fires a direct hit",
  "the under-arm flicks it onto the stumps. The batsman has to depart! Back of a length and on middle, pushed to short midwicket, the fielder swoops down on the ball and hits the stumps. THe victim turns back and dives in vain. Too late. The TV umpire rules it out.",
  "risky single, direct hit, and I think he's gone here. It was fired in quick and full, and the striker used the angle to tickle it towards short fine leg. His partner made the call for the single, but they realised both would have to dive to make ground, and even so the direct hit from caught him a foot short of the crease",
  "walks at the bowler, has a full toss, thumps it back towards long-on, but the non-striker's bat intervenes. The ball is deflected to the nearby fielder, who completes an easy run out. The skipper is livid as the striker, who had raced down the pitch looking for runs, but ends up going to the dressing room",
  "you can't look any prettier while getting out. Leans forward for a cover drive again, and it wasn't like it was an overpitched delivery. Lovely timing. But then he is eager to get back on strike, gets through for a couple of steps and then realises the danger. Sells his partner down the river.",
  "shortish and outside off, looks to stand and slog towards leg. Only gets an inside edge towards deep square leg. They're racing back, this is a good, flat through and he hasn't made it back",
  "full outside off, flat-batted firmly, the fielder gets a fingertip on it and deflects it into the stumps. They've gone to the third umpire, and has the batsman grounded his bat in time? Looks like it's in the air... one bail seems to be completely out of its groove too, and the big screen says 'OUT'",
  "he wants another run, but there has been run out. This was fuller on middle, he slogs it away to cow corner. The fielder there swoops down on the ball and fires a flattish throw to the man backing up, who does the rest.",
  "run out now? Gone to the third umpire this time! THe batsman pulled the short ball towards deep square leg and ran the first one very hard again so he did make it back in time. But the man backing up collected the throw and got a direct hit at the stumps to catch the victim short. Superb work...",
  "very full on middle, not quite a yorker, drilled down to long-on. The fielder swoops down on the ball and lets rip a flat throw to the man backing up. The pair hare across for the run, the batsman dives but is caught short, takes it on the half-volley and whipped the bails off. The batsman knew he was out, he started walking as soon as the stumps were disturbed.",
  "direct hit at the strikers', the man walks off! Yorker at the base of off, jammed out to the covers. The striker rushes across for a quick single, his partner reciprocates. A fieldsman lasers a direct hit and ends the partnership",
  "wide, he takes his time, aims at the stumps and hits it! This was a back of a length slower ball outside off, the batter throws his bat at it and is fooled by the change of pace. He seeks a quick single. The keeper collects the ball and effects an over-arm direct hit..",
  "he is out! Flicks this wristily towards mid-on. The ball is not hit well, which means they can think of a run. The fielder charges in, dives in to save time, is off balance, the ball hasn't sat properly in his right hand, but he flicks it underarm even as he comes down. The ball loops to the top of the stumps to catch the running batsman short",
  "madness! They were taking on the arm of the rocket man! The batter was halfway down and he had nowhere to go. He always wanted a run, after ticking the ball into the midwicket region. He wanted to play with soft hands, but the ball travelled quickly enough. The fieldsman swooped down on the ball - such speed - and an equally rapid throw does him.",
  "cuts the ball back in, the batter was looking for a flick and is dragged through for a risky single and a good throw hits the target. The ball had wandered away behind point, so it was the non-striker's call. So reasoning was sound, the fielders were just better."
