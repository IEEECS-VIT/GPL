                        By signing up for graVITas premier league 2.0, you agree to follow all undermentioned regulations.

                    <li><p>At the beginning of the event, each participant / team will have to create a squad of exactly 16
                        cricket players with the following specifications:
                        </p> 
                        <ul class="specs">
                            <li><p>7 batsmen</p></li>

                        <p>
                        The player categories will be explicitly mentioned during squad formation. The
                        appropriate amount will be deducted from the participant’s / team’s graVITas premier league auction
                        purse.
                        The surplus amount, if any will have no bearing whatsoever on future transactions, wherever
                        applicable.
                        <p>
                            <strong>Note</strong>: The purchase limit is virtual USD 10 million. All the individual player prices are scaled
                        accordingly.
                        </p>

                    <li><p>Before each match starts, participants / teams can customize their teams to form the final playing
                        eleven with the following restriction-this playing eleven should have exactly one all-rounder, five
                        batsmen and five bowlers. Participants / teams must also assign batting orders in order to
                        facilitate
                        squad rotation.
                    </p></li>
                    
                    <li><p>Participants shall be notified of their next match well in advance. At specified times, the game
                        engine will simulate the match, following which the participants will be able to see ball by ball
                        commentary and advanced statistical analytics.
                    </p></li>
                    
                    <li><p>Initially, each participant’s squad will play 7 matches with random opponent squads such that no two
                        teams play each other more than once. After this league stage has concluded, the top 25 % teams will
                        be shortlisted for the next round, where a similar process will be repeated. In the end, the 8
                        remaining finalists will participate in an actual player auction.
                    </p></li>
                    
                    <li><p>As an extension to clause 6, should there be any clash in terms of rankings between multiple teams
                        due to points, then the priority of ascension will be decided by the net run rate, which is
                        calculated as follows:
                        <div class="well"><small>(runs scored / overs batted) - (runs conceded / overs bowled)</small></div>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><p><strong>Scoring:</strong> Each victory earns the winning team 2 points, whereas the losing team gets 0 points. A
                        match shall be declared a tie, if all of the following conditions hold simultaneously:
                        <ol>
                            <li><p> The number of runs scored by both teams is exactly the
                                same.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p>The number of wickets lost by both teams is exactly the
                                same. If this does not hold, then the team that has lost fewer wickets shall be declared
                                victorious.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p>If the number of wickets lost is equal, then the team
                                with a higher run rate shall be declared victorious. In the highly unlikely event of the run
                                rates being equal, the match shall be declared a <strong>Tie</strong>, and both teams shall be awarded one
                                point apiece.
                            </p></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><p>If a participant has failed to produce his / her playing eleven before the start of the first match
                        of the first round, then that match shall be lost to the opposition. The same applies to all matches
                        for which the team is undefined.
