                    <li><p>All of the rules mentioned below are subject to change (wherever applicable) without prior
                            notice.
                            By signing up for graVITas premier league 2.0, you agree to follow all undermentioned
                            regulations.

                    <li><p>At the beginning of the event, each participant will have to create a squad of exactly 16
                            cricket players with exactly one coach and fifteen players.
                            The player categories will be explicitly mentioned during squad formation. The
                            appropriate amount will be deducted from the participant’s graVITas premier league auction
                            purse.
                            The surplus amount, if any will have no bearing whatsoever on future transactions, wherever
                            applicable.

                                <strong>Note</strong>: The purchase limit is virtual USD 10 million. All the individual

                                prices are scaled accordingly.

                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li><p>Before each match starts, participants can customize their teams to form the final playing
                            eleven. Participants can and are encouraged to facilitate squad rotation.
                        </p></li>

                    <li><p>Participants shall be notified of their next match well in advance. At specified times, the
                            game
                            engine will simulate the match, following which the participants will be able to see ball by
                            ball
                            commentary and advanced statistical analytics.
                        </p></li>

                    <li><p>Initially, each participant’s squad will play 7 matches with random opponent squads such that
                            no two teams play each other more than once. After this league stage has concluded, the top
                            25 % teams will be shortlisted for the next round, where a similar process will be repeated.
                            In the end, the 8 remaining finalists will participate in an actual player auction.
                        </p></li>

                    <li><p>As an extension to clause 6, should there be any clash in terms of rankings between multiple
                            teams due to points, then the priority of ascension will be decided by the net run rate,
                            which is calculated as follows:

                        <div class="well">
                            <small>(total runs scored / total overs batted) - (total runs conceded / total overs bowled)

                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li><p><strong>Scoring:</strong> Each victory earns the winning team 2 points, whereas the losing
                            team gets 0 points. A match shall be declared a tie, if all of the following conditions hold
                            simultaneously:
                        <ol>
                            <li><p> The number of runs scored by both teams is exactly the
                                    same.
                                </p></li>
                            <li><p>The number of wickets lost by both teams is exactly the
                                    same. If this does not hold, then the team that has lost fewer wickets shall be
                                    declared
                                    victorious.
                                </p></li>
                            <li><p>If the number of wickets lost is equal, then the team
                                    with a higher run rate shall be declared victorious. In the highly unlikely event of
                                    the
                                    run rates being equal, the match shall be declared a <strong>Tie</strong>, and both
                                    teams
                                    shall be awarded one point apiece.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <div class="well">
                            <small>Fun fact, among the 5, 348 matches form G.P.L 1.0 in 2014, only
                                one match was an actual TIE.
                            </small>
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <li><p>If a participant has failed to produce his / her playing eleven before the start of the first
                            match
                            of the first round, then that match shall be lost to the opposition. The same applies to all
                            matches
                            for which the team is undefined.
