                        cricket players with exactly one coach and fifteen players.
                        The player categories will be explicitly mentioned during squad formation. The
                        appropriate amount will be deducted from the participant’s graVITas premier league auction
                        purse.
                        The surplus amount, if any will have no bearing whatsoever on future transactions, wherever

                            25 % teams will be shortlisted for the next round, where a similar process will be repeated.
                            In the end, the 8 remaining finalists will participate in an actual player auction.

                            team gets 0 points. A match shall be declared a tie, if all of the following conditions hold
                            simultaneously:

                            <li><p>The number of wickets lost by both teams is exactly the
                                same. If this does not hold, then the team that has lost fewer wickets shall be declared
                                victorious.

                                with a higher run rate shall be declared victorious. In the highly unlikely event of the
                                run rates being equal, the match shall be declared a <strong>Tie</strong>, and both teams
                                shall be awarded one point apiece.
